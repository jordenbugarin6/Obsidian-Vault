In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- Discovery of Command Injection.
- Dealing with Common Protections.
- Enumeration and Exploitation
- Case Study - OpenNetAdmin (ONA).

In this Learning Module we will discuss a _Command Injection_[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/command-injection-35143/command-injection-35194#fn-local_id_306-1) attack.

Command injection occurs when executable code is added (or "injected") into a program. In the context of a web application, an attacker will often inject this code into a vulnerable parameter where it is executed by an _unsanitized system execution call_. From an attacker's perspective, the ultimate goal is system execution, often in the form of a shell.
