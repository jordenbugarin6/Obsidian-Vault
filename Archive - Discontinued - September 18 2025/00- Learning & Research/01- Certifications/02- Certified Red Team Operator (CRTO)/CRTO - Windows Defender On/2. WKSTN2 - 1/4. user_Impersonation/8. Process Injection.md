Beacon has two main injection commands - `shinject` and `inject`.  `shinject` allows you to inject any arbitrary shellcode from a binary file on your attacking machine; and `inject` will inject a full Beacon payload for the specified listener.

- 4464 is the target PID.
- x64 is the architecture of the process.
- tcp-local is the listener name.

`inject 760 x64 tcp-local` 
*Note that this is a bind shell*
- 760 is the target PID.
- x64 is the architecture of the process.
- tcp-localonly is the listener name.

The same caveats also apply - if the user closes this process, the Beacon will be lost.
