in this section, we'll improve our tradecraft by modifying our attack to execute the staged meterpreter payload directly in memory. this will be a slow process, but we will learn valuable techniques along the way.

this concept exceeds the limits of vba. this is partly because the staged meterpreter payload is pure assembly code that must be placed in a memory location and executed. instead of using pure vba, we can leverage native windows operating system apis  within vba.
