This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Understand how to launch Burp Suite from Kali Linux
- Understand how to use Burp Suite's built-in browser.
- Understand how we can integrate Burp Suite with other browsers.

When doing our web assessments, we're going to be in one of two browsers for the majority of our testing period. Most commonly, we make use of Burp Suite's built-in browser

This is the most effective browser for testing because of its direct integration into Burp Suite.

However, before we had Burp Suite's built-in browser, we had to do things a little differently. In the past, it was most efficient to configure Mozilla Firefox as our testing browser by adjusting its network and proxy settings.

In this Learning Unit, we're going to be discussing how to work with, and intercept requests from, both browser options.

#### 3.1.1 Launching Burpsuite
*Dont need directions on how to startup Burpsuite so skipping this section*

Started working VM for this section in the `resources` section

Adding to `/etc/hosts` as `offsecwp`

#### 3.1.2 Using Burp Suite's Built-in Browser
*Didnt bother doing this section in depth due to already knowing how to do this*
Burp Suite provides its own native built-in web browser based on [_Chromium_](https://www.chromium.org/). Let's familiarize ourselves with this tool first.

After launching Burp Suite, we'll click on the _Proxy_ tab, then the _Open Browser_ button.

With the _Intercept_ button de-activated, Burp's Proxy will automatically forward the requests the browser makes to the server. Regardless of the state of the _Intercept_ button, Burp Suite will store the requests we send.

#### 3.1.3 Integrating Burp Suite with Other Browsers

How to configure another browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy:
In Firefox, we can do this by navigating to **about:preferences#advanced**, scrolling down to _Network Settings_, and then clicking _Settings_.

Note that once we configure Firefox in this way, we will need Burp Suite running to access any website. To stop using Burp Suite as a proxy, we must return to connection settings and select _Use system proxy settings_ or _No proxy_. Alternatively, we could use any number of browser add-ons (such as [_FoxyProxy_](https://getfoxyproxy.org/)) to switch between proxy server settings.

Opened up a firefox and entered `about:preferences#advanced` in the browser and configured proxy settings below, this makes the traffic route through burpsuite.

In burpsuite ensure that the proxy is setup the same way.

##### Labs
- For some reason in this lab I wasnt capturing any of the traffic in the `HTTP` traffic when utilizing the Firefox browser, which is the one that you are supposed to run in order to get the flag.
- In `Firefox` throw in the `url:` **http://offsecwp/burp_exercise.php** and the flag will pop as long as you're running through firefox and going through the Burpsuite proxy.
