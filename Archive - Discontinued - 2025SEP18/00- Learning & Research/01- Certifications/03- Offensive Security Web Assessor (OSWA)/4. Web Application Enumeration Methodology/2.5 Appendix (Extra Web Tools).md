In addition to the tools discussed previously in this Learning Module, the following tools can also be useful during web application assessments.

---

_Proxy Tools_

- [_Burp Suite_](https://portswigger.net/burp) is a robust platform that can perform security testing of web applications. It includes several tools that can help identify web application vulnerabilities. There's a simplified free version available, but the professional/commercial version offers more comprehensive tools.
- [_Zed Attack Proxy_](https://www.zaproxy.org/) (ZAP) is a free, open-source web application security scanner. It includes features to allow automated and manual testing for web application vulnerabilities.
- [_Fiddler_](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) has several versions of its debugging proxy tool. While this tool can capture and inspect HTTP traffic, it does not include any security tools.

_Content Discovery Tools_

- [_DIRB_](https://dirb.sourceforge.net/) is a content scanner that uses a wordlist to discover web resources through brute forcing.

- [_DirBuster_](https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/) is a multi-threaded content scanner. It can be run with a GUI or headless. It is typically included in Kali Linux by default.

- [_Gobuster_](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) is a brute forcing tool written in Go, which usually makes it more performant than DIRB or DirBuster. Gobuster also supports enumerating DNS subdomains, and [_AWS S3_](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [_Google Cloud_](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets) buckets.

- [_Hakrawler_](https://github.com/hakluke/hakrawler) is a web crawler that discovers URLs and JavaScript files.

_Vulnerability Scanners_

- [_Nessus_](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) is a comprehensive commercial vulnerability scanning tool. It can identify a variety of vulnerabilities and provides detailed reports and remediation recommendations.
- [_Qualys_](https://www.qualys.com/) provides a selection of security tools, including commercial cloud security, compliance, and scanning services.
- [_OpenVAS_](https://www.openvas.org/) is an open source vulnerability scanner maintained by [_Greenbone_](https://www.greenbone.net/en/).

_Specialty Tools_

- [_Nikto_](https://cirt.net/Nikto2) is a free, open source web server scanner that can conduct comprehensive tests against web servers for various vulnerabilities.
- [_Wfuzz_](https://www.edge-security.com/wfuzz.php) is a web application brute forcing tool. We can use it for content discovery, fuzzing, or more advanced attacks.
- [_ffuf_](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) is a web application brute forcing tool similar to Wfuzz, but written in Go.
- [_sqlmap_](https://sqlmap.org/) is a tool for discovering and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in a variety of database servers.
- [_Metasploit Framework_](https://www.metasploit.com/) (MSF) is a pentesting framework with scanning and exploitation capabilities. While maintained by [_Rapid7_](https://www.rapid7.com/), it is frequently updated with new exploits by the community. For more information on using the Metasploit Framework, refer to OffSec's [_Metasploit Unleashed_](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/) (MSFU).
