A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When issuing a request to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token. Otherwise, the server will refuse to perform the requested action.

A common way to share CSRF tokens with the client is to include them as a hidden parameter in an HTML form, for example:
```js
<form name="change-email-form" action="/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
    <label>Email</label>
    <input required type="email" name="email" value="example@normal-website.com">
    <input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u">
    <button class='button' type='submit'> Update email </button>
</form>
```
<form name="change-email-form" action="/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
    <label>Email</label>
    <input required type="email" name="email" value="example@normal-website.com">
    <input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u">
    <button class='button' type='submit'> Update email </button>
</form>

----

Submitting this form results in the following request:
```http
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Length: 70
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

csrf=50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u&email=example@normal-website.com
```

When implemented correctly, CSRF tokens help protect against CSRF attacks by making it difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim. As the attacker has no way of predicting the correct value for the CSRF token, they won't be able to include it in the malicious request.

Note:

CSRF tokens don't have to be sent as hidden parameters in a POST request. Some applications place CSRF tokens in HTTP headers, for example. The way in which tokens are transmitted has a significant impact on the security of a mechanism as a whole. For more information, see How to prevent CSRF vulnerabilities.
