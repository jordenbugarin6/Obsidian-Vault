--------------
#### hakrawler
`echo "http://enum-sandbox" | hakrawler -u` is used as an automated gobuster that is quick, the `-u` option only shows unique instances - not repeated instances.

- We could redirect the output to a file to save the results. 
- We could also run Hakrawler with the **-proxy** option to proxy the requests through another tool.
