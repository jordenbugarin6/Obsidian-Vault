#### nmap
`nmap -p 80 --script http-methods enum-sandbox` futilizing NSE scripts (written in LUA) to identify http-methods

-------
#### HTTP Banner Grabbing
`curl -I http://enum-sandbox` manual banner grabbing `HTTP` protocols

- able to identify the version of the server
- When using curl, we can use the **-i** or **--include** options to include response headers in the output. If we only want the headers, we can use **-I** or **--head**.

-----
#### Non-HTTP Banner Grabbing
`netcat -v enum-sandbox 22` to grab version of ssh running

------
#### Manual HTTP Endpoint Discovery

- Make sure to always checkout `robots.txt` directory

-----
####  Automated HTTP Endpoint Discovery

- Make sure to utilize multiple webcrawlers for endpoint discovery such as `dirb`, `gobuster`, & `hakrawler`


`echo "http://enum-sandbox" | hakrawler -u` is used as an automated gobuster that is quick, the `-u` option only shows unique instances - not repeated instances.

`dirb http://enum-sandbox` DIRB missed several of the URLs discovered by Hakrawler. However, it found `http://enum-sandbox/server-status`, which Hakrawler didnt find

#### Information Disclosure

`ffuf -w users.txt -u http://enum-sandbox/auth/login -X POST -d 'username=FUZZ&password=bar' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`

----------
#### Sourcing Wordlists

`ls -lh /usr/share/wordlists`
- [_SecLists_](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) contains multiple wordlists that cover discovery, fuzzing, common passwords, and web shells.

`ls -lh /usr/share/payloadsallthethings`
- [_Payloads All The Things_](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) is another useful collection of wordlists focused on exploitation. This includes wordlists and markdown files with examples of many common web application vulnerabilities.

---------

#### Creating Custom Wordlists

`cewl --write output.txt --lowercase -m 4 http://enum-sandbox/manual`  
`tail output.txt` to show last 10 results from list

#### Authentication Bypass

When we run authentication bypass attacks, we're trying to gain new permissions within the target application. This could mean bypassing the authentication functionality entirely to log in without valid credentials through SQL injection, brute forcing credentials, or hijacking another user's session using cross-site scripting.

`ffuf -w output.txt -u http://enum-sandbox/auth/login -X POST -d 'username=e.freeman&password=FUZZ' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`
utilized the file `output.txt` that was created in [[2.3 - 2.3.2 Sourcing Wordlists]] as the password field to find the password of `innovative`
