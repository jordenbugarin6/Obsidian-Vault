March 2025 - Cobalt Strike 4.11
-------------
+ Updated BeaconGetSyscallInformation API (breaking change with previous versions).
+ Added "http-post" malleable C2 group options to control the size of parts of the POST response to bypass Data Exfiltration Prevention solutions and process responses faster.
  Use the "client_max_post_post_size" option to reduce the maximum posting size.
  Decreasing this this will cause HTTP posted data (with the POST verb) to be chucked into multiple smaller requests.
  Use the "client_max_post_get_size" option to control the size of chucked data (data sent per request) when beacon is posting with a GET verb into an HTTP Header.
  Increasing this size can speed up downloads and create less HTTP posting GET verb requests that are larger.
  Use the "client_max_post_get_packet" option to control the amount of file download data that a beacon can process during one cycle (check-in) when using HTTP Posts with the GET verb.
  Increasing this size can speed up downloads, but will create more HTTP post requests per cycle.
+ Added support for multiple hosts to beacon_config command.
+ Added DNS Over HTTPS (DOH) support to DNS beacons.
  Configuration is available in the "dns-beacon" malleable C2 section.
  The default option to enable the feature is set with the "comm_mode" malleable C2 option.
  Other DOH configuration options are available in the "dns-over-https" malleable C2 group.
  You can choose to override the default DOH enabled option when generating payloads from the UI or Aggressor scripts.
+ Overhaul default sleep mask so beacon/sleepmask are both automatically masked with proprietary evasion code.
  This applies to HTTP, HTTPS and DNS Beacons.
+ Updated the cobalt strike client to support the new bread_pipe aggressor function, which can be used to task beacon to read from the specified pipe name.
+ Added ability to run multiple BOFs asynchronously without blocking beacon.
  This ability is being released via the Arsenal Kit Postex Kit.
+ Update the bread_pipe aggressor function to support reading from the pipe that supports read_postex_kit_blob_from_pipe format.
+ Added support for additional Nt* API to Function/Syscall Resolution in the prepend loader, Beacon, and Aresenal Kit.
+ Added new default process injection method in Beacon.
+ Make prepend reflective loader the default loader used by Beacon.
  Added "stage.rdll_loader" malleable c2 option to use prepend (default) or stomp loader.
+ Use indirect system calls in prepend reflective loader by default.
  Added "stage.rdll_use_syscalls" malleable c2 option to disable system calls.
+ Changed "stage.obfuscate" behaviour to decouple copying the PE Header into the final beacon memory.
  The "stage.copy_pe_header" option will perform that.
  Added "stage.transform-obfuscate" which allows the user to use transformations to obfuscate the beacon dll payload for the prepend loader.
+ The prepend reflective loader will resolve system calls and pass to them Beacon via beacon user data (BUD).
+ Add support to handle fake PEB entries and EAT Protections with "stage.eaf_bypass" option.
+ Changed some default options in .stage malleable C2:
  sleep_mask :true
  transform-obfuscate: { xor 32 }
  cleanup : true
+ Add Client console option for wrapping long text lines on word breaks.
+ Change selected beacon console tab to switch as beacon table selected beacon changes.
+ Add options for copying data easier from Credentials list.
+ Add options to organise the output of the help command into groups to make things easier to find.
  See "help help" in the beacon and SSH consoles.
  Added "beacon_command_group" and "ssh_command_group" aggressor commands to define custom command help groups.
  Added help group ID parameter to "beacon_command_register" and "ssh_command_register" aggressor commands for linking commands to help groups.
+ Changed Client consoles to position at the bottom when opening.
+ Added Console Buffer Size - Preferences option to allow more console data before truncation occurs.
+ Updated CS Client to respond better to double click action in various places.
+ Updated CS Client to respond better to right click action on tabs for prompting to rename tabs.
+ Added beacon console metadata command line variables.
  See the "variables" command to show the list of variables that be used on the command line.
+ Fixed aggressor script error importing .jar files.
+ Fixed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) report and IOC report errors.
+ Added an option to disable auto scrolling in console windows.
+ Added killdate event logging.
  Added client UI warning banner to display killdate information starting 30 days prior.
  Added 'killdate' aggressor function to retrieve the killdate.
+ Fixed Preferences dialog incorrectly identifying team server SSL fingerprints as SHA-1 when they are SHA-256.
+ Added UPN type syntax support for make_token command.
+ Changed Mac Client Console key mapping to use standard Mac "meta Command+..." for Select All, Copy, Cut, and Paste.
