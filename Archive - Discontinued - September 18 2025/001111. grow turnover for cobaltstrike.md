license key gives access to cobaltstrike and arsenal kit


open with vs code once downloaded
unzip arsenal kit 
make sure to read the readme's
we do one main bypass in bypass-pipe.c
resource kit is for the powershell stuff


in compress.ps1 `gzipstream` can be detected

how to include custom `BOFs`
- any `BOFs` that are included are managed in own dbof directory

all the scripts that are used in `cobaltstrike` are this for now

![[Pasted image 20250122113925.png]]
once the scripts are loaded in cobalt, logout and copy the `.aggressor.prop` file to `/opt/cobaltstrike/client` and push it to github

once everything is there we encrypt it with this command 
![[Pasted image 20250122114249.png]]
```bash
7z a -mhe=on -r -p cs-20250122 /opt/cobaltstrike/
```
if you can use `artifact kit` and get it past `guardian` with artifacts and powershell runner then cobaltstrike is pretty good and good to package up and give to eric.
- malleable profiles like `custom.profile` are good to go for now, dont have to change anything 


utilize `github` `threat express repo` to update cobalt strike with latest one - dont have to do all the time
- can look in pull requests for updated ones because owners dont typically update but other people do


Download the `cobaltstrike` & `arsenalkit`, throw it into `VScode` and start customizing

just google download cobaltstrike and download arsenal kit

considerations fom grow:
use `guardian, frontiers, and gobots` for testing -  use threatcheck - go check - process hacker - windebug - ghidra

grab guardian from him 


get `cobaltstrike` get `arsenalkit`
- if any changes are made to artifact kit - must restart the server and if anything is made in resource kit  gotta reload the scripts

- can it execute the scripts fromr esource kit and can the artifact kit be executed on guardian
