# My unintended path

start at [[Whats the worst that could happen]] check point on `DC01.corp.local`

Utilized [[DC01 Domain bloodhound dump]] to get an idea of the next network.
![[Pasted image 20240110230802.png]]

utilizing `Bloodhound` revealed that `SVC_DEVOPS@CORP.LOCAL` is a local administrator on `WS03.DEV.ADMIN.OFFSHORE.COM` and also a part of `CORP.LOCAL` which we have `DA` for with the `IAMTHEADMINISTRATOR` account 
![[Pasted image 20240109151142.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240109151253.png]]
utilize these commands to change the password of `svc_devops` while being the `Domain Admin` account `corp\iamtheadministrator`
```powershell
$cred = ConvertTo-SecureString "bugsy_P4ss" -AsPlainText -force
Set-DomainUserPassword -identity svc_devops -accountpassword $cred
```
![[Pasted image 20240109164514.png]]
run `crackmapexec` to ensure that the password was changed
![[Pasted image 20240109164544.png]]
setup `SOCKS5` proxy pivot on `DC01` through a cobaltstrike beacon
![[Pasted image 20240109164629.png]]
`psexec'd` onto `ws03
this shell is very very slow due to going through proxychains

# Intended Path
looking in blood hound you identify that `JOE@DEV.ADMIN.OFFSHORE.COM` is a `local admin` to `WS03`
![[Pasted image 20240110234505.png]]
you can see that `joe` is able to rdp in.
![[Pasted image 20240110234531.png]]
you see that a password is not required for `joe`
![[Pasted image 20240110234608.png]]
you `proxychains rdesktop -u joe -d dev.admin.offshore.com 172.16.2.102` into a session that makes you want to cry
![[Pasted image 20240110234723.png]]
you `please wait` 
![[Pasted image 20240110234749.png]]
you click on `dev.admin.offshore.com\joe` or other user to login as joe with no password
![[Pasted image 20240110234952.png]]
it says `welcome` for 3 minutes  ( you dont feel welcome at all )
![[Pasted image 20240110235159.png]]
you find elwoods stuff upon opening and proceed to get a cobalt strike beacon to grab the first flag `headed down another path`
