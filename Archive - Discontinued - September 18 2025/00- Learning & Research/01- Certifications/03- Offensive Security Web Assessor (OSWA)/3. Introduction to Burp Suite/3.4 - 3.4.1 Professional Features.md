Here we will be providing a brief overview of what core professional features exist within a paid version of Burp Suite. A professional version of Burp Suite can be acquired directly through PortSwigger's website.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

- Understand the professional features of Burp Suite's Scanner tool.
- Understand the professional features of Burp Suite's Collaborator tool.
- Understand the professional features of Burp Suite's Intruder tool.
- Understand the professional features of Burp Suite's CSRF PoC Generation tool.

Before we begin this section, we would like to put heavy emphasis on the fact that these **professional features are by no means necessary to complete any of our course material**. With that being said, we will cover the core principles behind the professional features that Burp Suite offers should a student ever decide to purchase an individual license.

In this Learning Unit, we're going to briefly cover the individual features of Burp Suite's _Scanner_ tool, _Collaborator_, and the modified Intruder aspects.

--------------------------------------------------
#### 3.4.1. Burp Scanner, Active Scan, Collaborator, and Intruder

First, let's talk about the functionality that comes along with a Professional Burp Suite license. Commonly known as the [Burp Scanner](https://portswigger.net/burp/vulnerability-scanner), this tool will perform automated scanning on a domain, an endpoint, or even from a specific intercepted request. Burp Suite's built-in scanner will crawl first for information and [_spider_](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-web-crawler/) over a website with very light traffic to develop a map for what comes next, which is the active scan itself.

In other words, the built-in Burp Scanner will make an attempt to crawl a website and then perform automated vulnerability scanning.

In addition, there are also extensions that can be downloaded and integrated into Burp Suite that will "boost" the functionality of a pre-existing tool or function, such as [ActiveScan++](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/3123d5b5f25c4128894d97ea1acc4976) which extends the native passive and active scanner.

Next, we have the [Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/collaborator) tool. This tool is particularly fantastic as it acts as a kind of "passive partner" for discovering vulnerabilities in web applications. Whenever we would decide to activate Collaborator, all of our requests and payloads will be sent additionally to the Collaborator server, which is started the moment we activate the tool. If the Collaborator server detects any interaction between the request made and its internal database, the tester will be notified. Hence, the name of "Collaborator" is given to this tool as the tester is meant to work alongside and collaborate with the server.

Also of note is the primary change that comes with [Burp Suite's Intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/using). In Burp Suite Community Edition, a tester can technically use the Intruder tool; however, testers will be prompted and notified of the fact that Burp Suite is performing throttling to slow down the rate at which brute force traffic is generated. With Burp Suite Professional Edition, this limit is lifted and no such throttling occurs, allowing us to perform many aggressive wordlist attacks without waiting for too long.

Lastly, let's cover the benefits of CSRF PoC generation. The [_Generate CSRF PoC_](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-web-crawler/) tool will perform a deep analysis on an HTML form or input elements that are submitted to a target server for processing and create a potential candidate [_proof of concept_](https://mindcraft.top/definition-of-proof-of-concept-poc-exploit-understanding-the-basics-from-techtarget/) (PoC) for a [_Cross-Site Request Forgery_](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-csrf.html) (CSRF) attack.

Even if a form is not actually vulnerable, Burp Suite Professional will still make an attempt to create or "generate" a CSRF PoC.
