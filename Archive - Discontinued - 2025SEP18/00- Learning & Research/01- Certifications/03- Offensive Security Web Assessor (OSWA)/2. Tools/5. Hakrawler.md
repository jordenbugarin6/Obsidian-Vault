Hakrawler's power lies in its ability to combine spidering techniques with the Wayback Machine, thus providing us with a large list of previously used or archived domains that would otherwise need to be "busted" via tools like Wfuzz or GoBuster.

The Wayback Machine archives include both web page source code and visual snapshots for each domain. Hakrawler takes advantage of this, and will scour the archives for endpoints that might have been left behind by developers. `This is incredibly useful in real-world engagements`, where we can use Wfuzz and GoBuster to discover directories and files, combined with Hakrawler to discover the trails left behind from old directories, previous versions of a website, and so on.

Now that we better understand Hakrawler, let's use it to target `https://www.megacorpone.com/` with a file called urls.txt.

We cat the information stored in `urls.txt` in the same directory where we created it. Then, we pipe those URLs to be handled by Hakrawler and finally review the output below.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ echo "https://www.megacorpone.com/" > urls.txt

kali@kali:~$ cat urls.txt |./hakrawler
