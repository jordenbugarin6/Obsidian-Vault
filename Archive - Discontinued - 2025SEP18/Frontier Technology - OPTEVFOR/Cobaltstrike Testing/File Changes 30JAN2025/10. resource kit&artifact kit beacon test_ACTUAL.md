#### Cobalt Strike Cleanup Script
now testing is done and both `artifact kit` and `resource kit` are working, time to wipe it clean with `./clearteamserverdata`
![[Pasted image 20250130210219.png]]
reboot the `teamserver` and log back in to the fresh `cobaltstrike`
```bash

in `script manager` `unload` and `load` the new `arsenal_kit.cna` to be safe
![[Pasted image 20250130210513.png]]
once that is completed, close out of `cobaltstrike` and shutdown the `teamserver` and copy the `.aggressor.prop` file to `/opt/cobaltstrike/client`
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[31Jan2025 02:08:39]-[/opt/cobaltstrike_30JAN2025/custom-cobalt/Files]
â””â”€# cp .aggressor.prop /opt/cobaltstrike_30JAN2025/client 
```
proof it was moved

```bash
7z a -mhe=on -r -p cs-20250130 /opt/cobaltstrike_30JAN2025/
