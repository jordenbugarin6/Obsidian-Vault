- If running into issues with `resource kit` it probably needs a new `AMSI` 
- Note that if you find a new `AMSI` just because it runs by itself to disable `AMSI` does not mean that it will work with `compress.ps1` it also might need some changes

- an example is the `https://github.com/cybersectroll/TrollAMSI` `AMSI` works, but it does not bypass defender when implemented into `compress.ps1`
