here we go to `http://megacorpone.com` with the `Requests library` active which is utilizing `python` to send the requests and we get the `index page` of the website
- this is showing that we are able to access websites as a proxy through the vulnerable server if `SSRF` exists on it

`Blind SSRF` also exists where we do not have direct acess to the content of the `request` 
- this is harder to exploit
- here we use the same `http://wwww.megacorpone.com` with the `python Requests Library` utility but only get `URL` Verified. We have no idea what actually happened though

we are able to test what happened if we connect to our own `kali` machine
- we can test this utilizing `2` different methods, the first is my open a `python3 -m http.server`
- the second is by starting a `apache2` server and looking at the `/var/log/apache2/access.log`
