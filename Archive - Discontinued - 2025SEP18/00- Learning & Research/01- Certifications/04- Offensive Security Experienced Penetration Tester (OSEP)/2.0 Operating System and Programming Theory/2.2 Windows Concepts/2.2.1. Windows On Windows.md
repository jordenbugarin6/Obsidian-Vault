 ----------
- most windows machines run a `64-bit` version of the operating system
- many applications are still `32-bit`
- microsoft created`windows on windows 64-bit` (wow64) to allow `64-bit` windows to run `32-bit` apps efficiently
- wow64 uses four 64-bit libraries to handle this translation:
	  - `ntdll.dll`
	  - `wow64.dll`
	  - `wow64win.dll`
	  - `wow64cpu.dll`
- these libraries emulate `32-bit` execution and translate system calls between the `32-bit` app and the `64-bit` kernel
- on `32-bit` versions of windows, most native windows applications and libraries are stored in `c:\windows\system32`. on `64-bit versions` of windows, 64-bit native programs and dlls are stored in `c:\windows\system32` and `32-bit` versions are stored in `c:\windows\syswow64`.
