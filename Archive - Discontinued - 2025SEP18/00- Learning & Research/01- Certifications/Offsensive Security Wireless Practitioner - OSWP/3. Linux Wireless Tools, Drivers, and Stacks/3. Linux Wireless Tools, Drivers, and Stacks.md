In this module, we will cover the Linux wireless subsystem.

We'll start off discussing some of the tools that we'll be using in the course. Often, we will interact with our wireless card through a nice user interface in a piece of software, but there are circumstances that require a penetration tester to understand and be able to use the tools that are "under the surface".

One example of a situation where a knowledge of the tools is absolutely critical is in a _remote_ wireless penetration test. A system administrator will set up a machine with a wireless card on site and allow us to interact remotely via SSH. In these cases, we may not have access to familiar, well-tested hardware. The capabilities and limitations of the card chosen by the system administrator are critical, and we must be able to handle instances where drivers misbehave using the tools described below.

In addition, we're going to discuss the Linux drivers and wireless stacks. Much of the information in this portion of the module will be useful when using unfamiliar or uncooperative wireless cards, when troubleshooting, and for future reference.
