## Listener Management
`change malleable c2 to present a different IP address when being looked up`
Since 0.0.0.0 is the default response (and also rather nonsensical), Cobalt Strike team servers can be fingerprinted in this way.  This can be changed in the Malleable C2 profile

`used when creating pipenames for SMB Listeners `
This default pipe name is quite well signatured.  A good strategy is to emulate names known to be used by common applications or Windows itself.  Use `PS C:\> ls \\.\pipe\` to list all currently listening pipes for inspiration.

## Interacting with Beacon
`make the beacon sleep for longer if concerned about being caught`
Although this is nicer for us because we don't have to sit around waiting for as long, you can appreciate how much noisier it is on the wire.  The more noise your C2 channel makes, the more likely it is to get caught.


## Overpass the Hash to grab TGT is safer
