click my account and login with the credentials `wiener:peter`

once logged in we get a `update email` field, enter in `test@local.com` to generate a `post` request
![[Pasted image 20241230183452.png]]
now that we have a `POST` request just `right click` and generate `CSRF` payload
![[Pasted image 20241230183700.png]]
now that we have a `CSRF` payload change the email to `test2@local.com`
![[Pasted image 20241230183745.png]]
click `Go To Exploit Server` to be able to complete the payload
![[Pasted image 20241230183832.png]]
enter the  payload in the body and hit `View Exploit`
![[Pasted image 20241230183929.png]]
viewing the exploit shows that the email was indeed changed to the `test2local.com`
![[Pasted image 20241230184004.png]]
now click `Deliver Exploit to the Victim` while changing the email to `test3@local.com`
