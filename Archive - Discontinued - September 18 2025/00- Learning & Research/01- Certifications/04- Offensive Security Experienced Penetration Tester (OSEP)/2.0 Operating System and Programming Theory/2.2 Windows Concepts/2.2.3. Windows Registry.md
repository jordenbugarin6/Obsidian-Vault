 ----------
 
- many programming languages support the concept of local and global variables, where local variables are limited in scope and global variables are usable anywhere in the code. an operating system needs global variables in much the same manner. windows uses the `registry` to store many of these.
-  in this section, we'll discuss the registry since it contains important information that can be abused during attacks, and some modifications may allow us to bypass specific defenses.
-  the registry is effectively a database that consists of a massive number of keys with associated values. these keys are sorted hierarchically using subkeys.
- at the root, multiple `registry hives` contain logical divisions of registry keys. information related to the current user is stored in the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` (_HKCU_) hive, while information related to the operating system itself is stored in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` (_HKLM_) hive.

***The HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive is writable by the current user while modification of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive requires administrative privileges.***

- we can interface with the registry both programmatically through the Win32 APIs as well as through the GUI with tools like the `Registry Editor` (regedit)

- since a 64-bit version of windows can execute 32-bit applications each registry hive contains a duplicate section called `Wow6432Node` which stores the appropriate 32-bit settings.
