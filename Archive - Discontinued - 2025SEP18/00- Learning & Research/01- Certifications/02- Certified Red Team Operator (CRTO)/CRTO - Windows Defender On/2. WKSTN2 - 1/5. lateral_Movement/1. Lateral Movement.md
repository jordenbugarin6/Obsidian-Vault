When laterally moving with `cobalt strike` the command to be used is `jump`  which is also the most convenient. This will spawn a Beacon payload on the remote target, and if using a P2P listener, will connect to it automatically.

the second strategy is to used `remote-exec` which requires a more manual approach to connect to beacon

*The `remote-exec` commands simply provide a means of executing commands on a remote target.  They are therefore not exclusive to lateral movement, but they can be used as such.  They require more manual work to manage the payload, but do offer a wider degree of control over what gets executed on the target.  You also need to connect to P2P Beacons manually using `connect` or `link`.*

*The third is to use Cobalt Strike's other primitives (`powershell`, `execute-assembly`, etc) to implement something entirely custom.  This requires the most amount of effort but also offers you the greatest degree of control.  Custom methods can be integrated into the `jump` and `remote-exec` commands using Aggressor.*


# Enumeration after Initial Access and Impersonating 
`Seatbelt.exe` is able to be used to enumerate different machines on the network as long as you are `Impersonating` someone that is a `Administrator` or has access to the machine
```powershell
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Seatbelt\Seatbelt\bin\Release\Seatbelt.exe OSInfo -ComputerName=web
