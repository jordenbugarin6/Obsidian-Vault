ok to get the card to work, i had to put in in a `usb2.0` port on the back

testing with `airodump-ng`
```bash
sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0
sudo rfkill unblock all
sudo iw reg set US
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
sudo iwconfig         # confirm wlan0 is in monitor mode
sudo airodump-ng wlan0
```
monitor mode interface got renamed from `wlan0` → `wlan0mon`

run this to test if working

```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```
still not getting any results

#### Final VM
## 🛠️ Final Suggestion for VMware Users

If you want to keep working in the VM:

- Use a **powered USB 2.0 hub** (yes — this actually solves Realtek/Ralink flakiness sometimes)
    
- Try **VirtualBox** with USB 2.0 + Extension Pack instead
    
- Or dual-boot or Live USB Kali for clean RF handling

Want me to script out a test sequence you can run to log what the card's actually doing behind the scenes (via `iw`, `tcpdump`, etc.)? I got you.

##### You said:

so at this point you just tink its vmware

###### ChatGPT said:

Yep — **based on everything you’ve shown**, I’m now **95% confident** the issue is VMware’s USB passthrough layer silently breaking RF reception.

Here’s why:

---

### 🔍 All signs point to the VM:

|✅ What Works|❌ What Fails|
|---|---|
|Card is detected by `lsusb`|`airodump-ng` sees 0 APs|
|`wlan0mon` exists in monitor mode|`iwconfig` shows no RX packets|
|Tx-Power and frequency are good|No traffic seen, no injection|
|You’re using a supported chipset|Still doesn’t work despite correct drivers, reg domain, and setup|

---

### 🧠 Realtek/Ralink + VMware = Historically Sketchy

- VMware **does not emulate the hardware directly**, it proxies USB calls via a virtualization layer
    
- This layer **breaks passive RF reception and monitor mode** _even though everything looks normal_
    
- Especially common with **RT3070**, **RTL8812AU**, and **RTL8187**
    

And you've already:

- Set reg domain
    
- Loaded the right driver
    
- Entered monitor mode manually
    
- Scanned specific channels
    
- Started NetworkManager
    
- Still get **zero RX packets**
