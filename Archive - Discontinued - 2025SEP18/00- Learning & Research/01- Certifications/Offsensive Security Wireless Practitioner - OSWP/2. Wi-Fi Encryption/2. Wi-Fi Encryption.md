Wi-Fi works over radio waves, which means it is subject to eavesdropping and therefore, encryption has to be used to protect the transmitted data.

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wi-fi-encryption-15794/wi-fi-encryption-16024#fn-local_id_213-1) was created when the 802.11 standard was released in order to give privacy features similar to those found in wired networks.

As soon as flaws were discovered in WEP (WEP can be cracked in under a minute), the IEEE created a new group called 802.11i aimed at improving Wi-Fi security. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wi-fi-encryption-15794/wi-fi-encryption-16024#fn-local_id_213-2) superseded WEP in 2003, followed by WPA2 in 2004 (802.11i standard).

Soon after, technologies from various vendors allowed users to securely share the passphrases on devices to be added on the network without having to type it. Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wi-fi-encryption-15794/wi-fi-encryption-16024#fn-local_id_213-3) was released in 2006 to standardize it.

WPA3 was first announced by the Wi-Fi Alliance in January 2018 and released in June the same year[4](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wi-fi-encryption-15794/wi-fi-encryption-16024#fn-local_id_213-4). It isn't meant to replace any existing security solutions but aims to solve a few key problems with the following:

- Forward secrecy, using a Dragonfly handshake, with SAE[5](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wi-fi-encryption-15794/wi-fi-encryption-16024#fn-local_id_213-5)
- Simplify process of configuring devices with no display (such as IoT)
- A new 192-bit mode for enterprise networks with stronger cipher suites
- Mandatory use of Protected Management Frames (PMF), from 802.11w

Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE), also known as "Enhanced Opened", adds encryption to public Wi-Fi networks.
