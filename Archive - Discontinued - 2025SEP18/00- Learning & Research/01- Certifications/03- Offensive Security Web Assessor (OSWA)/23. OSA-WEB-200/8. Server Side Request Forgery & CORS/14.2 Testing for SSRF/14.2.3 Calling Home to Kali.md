`1st`
opening the `python3` port `8000` listener
```bash
rootðŸ’€gobots)-[08Jan2025 06:13:54]-[/home/kali/SUT/OSWA]
â””â”€# python3 -m http.server 8000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...      
```
utilizing the `http://192168.45.245:8000/hello_ssrf` to hit my `kali` machine
![[Pasted image 20250108011700.png]]
looking back at the `kali` machine we can see we get a `404` error but we dont see anything else other than the file reaching this can cause some issues.
- an issue that can be caused by only utilizing a `python3` server is it might lack information and if this is the only method we test for it could lead to missed information
***this kind of thing happened in my `OSWA` exam and I only looked at the `python3` server results***

`2nd`
starting `apache2` server
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[08Jan2025 06:27:32]-[/home/kali]
â””â”€# systemctl restart apache2
```
resending the same `hello_ssrf` message but to `port 80` the `apache2` server instead
![[Pasted image 20250108012905.png]]now if we look at the results of the acces log with `tail /var/log/apache2/access.log` we can see that the `server` is running `python 2.26.0` which could be a vector or aid in further exploitation
- the lesson is to run both just in case.

#### Labs
`1.`
![[Pasted image 20250108013214.png]]
changing the `utility` at `ssrf-sandbox/verify` to `curl` instead of `Requests Library` to port `80` the `apache2` server
![[Pasted image 20250108013350.png]]
got the `HEAD` request and able to see that `curl/7.79.1` is being utilized
![[Pasted image 20250108013548.png]]
now to test sending this to our `python3` server lets see what the results are
- we got no `curl` version in the header

`2.`
![[Pasted image 20250108013820.png]]
here we have to ensure that it gets a `200` error to collect the flag so i am creating a file named `challenge.txt` so we are able to get a `200` error
![[Pasted image 20250108014132.png]]
copying the file over to `/var/www/html` as well so we can test against the `apache2` server
![[Pasted image 20250108014225.png]]
sending the payload to hit `challenge.txt` to the `python3` server
![[Pasted image 20250108014506.png]]
after looking at the `python3` server it looks like the `SSRF` challenge is specifically looking for the `/tweedledum` directory not the `challenge.txt` so we are going to make that directory to try to get the `200` error
![[Pasted image 20250108014624.png]]created `/tweedledum` directory
![[Pasted image 20250108014959.png]]
got the flag because the `/tweedledum` directory was present
![[Pasted image 20250108015045.png]]
can see the `200` server in the `python3` server
![[Pasted image 20250108015110.png]]
going to create the `tweedledum` directory in `/var/www/html/` to see what the results look like in an `apache2` server
- here we can see the `200` error that gives the same flag as the `python3` server as well as the version of `python` that the `blindSSRF` is running.
