### 4.1.1. Welcome Screen

When launched, Wireshark presents a screen like the one in Figure 1 below.
![[Pasted image 20250415175426.png]]This screen displays the _Display Filter_, recently opened files, the _Capture Filter_ setup, the list of interfaces, the traffic sparklines, and other relevant information. The sparklines show network activity on each of the interfaces and they go up and down depending on the amount of traffic. Wireshark refreshes the interfaces list as they are removed or added, but it doesn't show ones that are down.

To the right of the capture filter textbox there is a dropdown that displays the different types of interfaces available. Checking and unchecking will show or hide certain interfaces based on their type. We will select _Wireless_ in order to focus on wireless only.
