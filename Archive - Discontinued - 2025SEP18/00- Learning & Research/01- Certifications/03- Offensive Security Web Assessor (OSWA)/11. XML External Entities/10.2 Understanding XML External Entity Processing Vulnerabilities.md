This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:

1. Understand the basic concepts of XML External Entity injection

As discussed in the previous section, external entities can often access local or remote content via declared system identifiers. An _XML External Entity_ (XXE)[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/xml-external-entities-30967/introduction-to-xml-31281/xml-entities-31030#fn-local_id_95-1) injection is a specific type of attack against XML parsers. In a typical XXE injection, the attacker forces the XML parser to process one or more external entities, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information not normally accessible by the application. In order for this attack to succeed, we must be able to provide the target XML processor with a maliciously-crafted XML request containing system identifiers that point to sensitive data.

There are many XXE attack techniques that allow an attacker to exfiltrate both text and binary data. In addition, depending on the application's programming language and the available protocol wrappers, we may be able to leverage this attack to gain full command injection.
