The delivery mechanisms for cross-site request forgery attacks are essentially the same as for reflected XSS. Typically, the attacker will place the malicious HTML onto a website that they control, and then induce victims to visit that website. This might be done by feeding the user a link to the website, via an email or social media message. Or if the attack is placed into a popular website (for example, in a user comment), they might just wait for users to visit the website.

Note that some simple CSRF exploits employ the GET method and can be fully self-contained with a single URL on the vulnerable website. In this situation, the attacker may not need to employ an external site, and can directly feed victims a malicious URL on the vulnerable domain. In the preceding example, if the request to change email address can be performed with the GET method, then a self-contained attack would look like this:

```js
<img src="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net">
```
