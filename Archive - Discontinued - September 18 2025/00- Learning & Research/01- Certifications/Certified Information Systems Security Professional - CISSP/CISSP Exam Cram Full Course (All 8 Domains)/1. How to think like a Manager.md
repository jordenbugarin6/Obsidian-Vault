## Due Care
***Implementation Operation (upkeep) of Reasonable measures*** - *largely after the decision*
-  Doing after the decision
- Actions speak louder than words
- Do Correct
- After

# Know your Priorities
Pretend that you are the CISO, I am tasked to deal with risks that are escalated to the top, and pass down objectives that can be handled from the top down to the *IT Director or Manager, or to the IT engineer* for Tactical (Midrange), and Operational (Short Term) Priorities and Objectives.


***A CISO's focus is at the Strategic level at the top of the pyramid.***
- Focusing on human safety, business continuity, protecting profits, reducing liability & risk.
- Passing Priorities & Objectives down to teams below in which they should implement in ***policy and planning*** then actually **implementing & operate*** the objectives on a day to day operations.

# Don't Touch, Advise!
***During the exam, think of yourself as an outside security consultant advising an organization!***
***You are advising on strategy, priorities, and safety, not doing!***
- Focus on bringing focus to process, role, due diligence and due care.
