In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- Introduction to XML
- Understanding XML External Entity Processing Vulnerabilities
- Testing for XXE
- Case Study: Apache OFBiz XXE Vulnerability

_Extensible Markup Language_ (XML)[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/xml-external-entities-30967/xml-external-entities-31472#fn-local_id_486-1) encodes data in a way that's easier for humans and machines to read. Applications that use XML will often use a parser to validate the data and convert it into an internal object. For example, an application may export a contact from an address book in XML format, or an application may accept an inventory catalog as input.

Like any application component that parses user input, XML processors may contain various vulnerabilities originating from malformed or malicious input data.

XML parsing vulnerabilities can, at times, serve as powerful _primitives_,[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/xml-external-entities-30967/xml-external-entities-31472#fn-local_id_486-2) or building blocks, to an attacker. Depending on the programming language an XML parser is written in, these primitives can eventually be chained together to achieve devastating effects such as information disclosure, server-side request forgery (SSRF), denial of service, remote command injection, or remote code execution (RCE).

In this Learning Module, we will focus on leveraging _XML External Entity_ (XXE)[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/xml-external-entities-30967/xml-external-entities-31472#fn-local_id_486-3) injection attacks against vulnerable XML parsers. We'll begin with a review of XML basics, discuss XML parser vulnerabilities, and exploit these vulnerabilities on _Apache OFBiz_.
