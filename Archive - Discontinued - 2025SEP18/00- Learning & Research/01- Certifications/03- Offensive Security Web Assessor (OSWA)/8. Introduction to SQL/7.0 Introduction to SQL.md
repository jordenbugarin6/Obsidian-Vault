In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- Introduction to SQL
- Enumerating MySQL Databases
- Enumerating Microsoft SQL Server Databases
- Enumerating PostgreSQL Databases
- Enumerating Oracle Databases

In this Learning Module, we'll review theÂ _Structured Query Language_Â (SQL).[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/introduction-to-sql-30959/introduction-to-sql-31491#fn-local_id_63-1)Â We'll start this Learning Module by reviewing some basic SQL syntax. Once we have the basics down, we'll discuss some database-specific queries that we can use to enumerate four common databases.

A subsequent Learning Module will coverÂ _SQL injection_,[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/introduction-to-sql-30959/introduction-to-sql-31491#fn-local_id_63-2)Â common web vulnerability, including several techniques for discovery and exploitation, a tool for automating SQL injection attacks, and a case study found in a real-world application.

We'll primarily useÂ _SQL Sandbox_, a custom sandbox application with access to multiple databases, to learn about SQL injection throughout this Learning Module.

We can access this application via theÂ `/etc/hostsÂ file` entry on our Kali Linux VM.
