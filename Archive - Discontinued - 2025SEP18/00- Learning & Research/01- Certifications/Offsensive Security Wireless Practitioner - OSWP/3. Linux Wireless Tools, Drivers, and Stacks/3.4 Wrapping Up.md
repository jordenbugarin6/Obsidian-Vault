In this module we discussed wireless tools, stacks, and drivers. A basic understanding of many of the concepts here will be helpful in cases where we are working with unfamiliar or uncooperative adapters. Here, we used the Alfa AWUS036AC as an example and showed all the different ways we can find its chipset and driver.

Finally, we went back in time and explored the Linux ieee80211 subsystem, which was used for drivers until around 802.11g/802.11n, and was progressively superseded by mac80211. All new Linux kernel drivers are developed using the mac80211 framework.

The mac80211 framework simplifies driver development, allowing for bug fixes and providing new features to all drivers at the same time. mac80211 can now handle newer wireless technologies with ease and iw provides us with one utility to rule them all.
