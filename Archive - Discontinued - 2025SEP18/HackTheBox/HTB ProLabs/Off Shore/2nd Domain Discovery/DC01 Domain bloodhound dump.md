utilized this command to dump a new Domain Bloodhound
```powershell
beacon> execute-assembly /usr/libbloodhound/resources/app/Collectors/SharpHound.exe -c all --ldapusername bill --ldappassword "I like to map Shares!" --domain DEV.ADMIN.OFFSHORE.COM
```
once bloodhound is opened search `CORP.LOCAL` and `First Degree Trusts` to see that `DEV.ADMIN.OFFSHORE.COM` is the next step.
![[Pasted image 20240104151031.png]]after searching `ADMIN.OFFSHORE.COM` we can see that two devices populate, these are the next steps
the `DC02`
![[Pasted image 20240104151404.png]]
& `WS03` - WS03 is the next step in the attack chain
![[Pasted image 20240104151444.png]]
utilizing the `DC01` beacon and pinging these `FQDN`'s I am able to get actual IP addresses

utilizing `Bloodhound` revealed that `SVC_DEVOPS@CORP.LOCAL` is a local administrator on `WS03.DEV.ADMIN.OFFSHORE.COM` and also a part of `CORP.LOCAL` which we have `DA` for with the `IAMTHEADMINISTRATOR` account
