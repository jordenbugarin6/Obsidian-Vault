In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- An Introduction to IDOR
- Exploiting IDOR in the Sandbox Application
- Case Study: OpenEMR

_Insecure Direct Object Referencing_ (IDOR)[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/insecure-direct-object-referencing-36181/insecure-direct-object-referencing-36228#fn-local_id_78-1) occurs when a web application utilizes a resource that itself discloses a reference to an internal object. This often means that web applications will handle certain types of data such as files, users, database information, or in some cases, directly iterative objects.

An IDOR finding impacts the confidentiality of an application's data. The severity of such a finding depends on the data exposed. For example, an IDOR vulnerability leading to the exposure of confidential information like medical records or intellectual property might be considered a critical vulnerability.

Vulnerability scanners may not always identify IDOR vulnerabilities. Scanners can identify sensitive data with set patterns, such as credit cards. However, for any other types of data with non-defined patterns, a penetration tester will need to perform manual inspection to determine if IDOR has occurred.

In the next Learning Unit, we will discuss the different types of IDOR that can occur in modern web applications.
