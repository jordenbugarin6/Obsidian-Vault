### High-Level Summary

A brief description of the attack chain with machine names, including the depth of compromise should be included here.
### Chain of Attack

The chain of attack followed for getting into the machines from above in the network DOMAIN was as follows:

* 1 -
* 2 -
* 3 -
* 4 -
* N -
* 9 -

-------------
### Computer Information

Hostname:
IP Address:
MAC Address:
Open Ports:
Anti Virus:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Pre-Compromise Enumeration Steps

Provide relevant techniques and methods used to perform enumeration prior to initial compromise, the steps taken should be able to be easily followed and reproducible if necessary. Include any reference to public tools, if custom code then reference it in the Appendix, for example "Code for AMSI Bypass in Appendix 4.1".

-----------

#### Compromise

Provide a description of exploitation steps to compromise the machine and obtain shell access, the steps taken should be able to be easily followed and reproducible if necessary. Only the steps that ended up working are required. Include any reference to public tools, if custom code then reference it in the Appendix, for example "Code for AMSI Bypass in Appendix 4.1".

------
#### Post-Exploitation Enumeration Steps

Provide relevant post-exploitation enumeration steps related to the network or local privilege escalation, the steps taken should be able to be easily followed and reproducible if necessary. Include any reference to public tools, if custom code then reference it in the Appendix, for example "Code for AMSI Bypass in Appendix 4.1".

---

#### Local Privilege Escalation

Provide a description of exploitation steps to escalate privileges on the machine if applicable, the steps taken should be able to be easily followed and reproducible if necessary. Include any reference to public tools, if custom code then reference it in the Appendix, for example "Code for AMSI Bypass in Appendix 4.1".
