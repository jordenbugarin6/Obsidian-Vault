#### 2.1 Web Application Reconnaissance:
Open Source intelligence is the first step, Typically dont inteact with the target while gathering OSINT. But you can do regular activities that a normal user would do such as creating an account.

##### 2.1.1: Determining the Scope
There may be some negotiation involved when defining the scope of an external engagement. As we perform reconnaissance and enumeration, we may discover additional domains or functionalities that we need to review with our client to determine if they fall within the scope of the assessment.

##### 2.1.2: Passive Information Gathering
first step is to run a `whois` query.
```bash
whois megacorpone.com
```
We may also find it useful to collect information about the employees at the target organization, such as employee names and email addresses. We can refer to this information when we are attempting to determine valid usernames, such as when we test login functionality.

Corporate sites often include information about high-level employees. We can also use social media and public search engines to find information about employees. Some companies have public repositories on GitHub, GitLab, or similar sites. These repositories can be a useful source of information beyond employee names. Having an idea of what programming languages and frameworks we might encounter can help us pick the right attack payloads.

While not necessary in our lab environment, we can identify subdomains using tools likes [_DNSDumpster_](https://dnsdumpster.com/) or through [_certificate transparency_](https://certificate.transparency.dev/) using tools like [_crt.sh_](https://crt.sh/). Certificate transparency details can include information such as an organization using a public certificate authority to issue certificates for private subdomains, thereby leaking those private subdomain names.

Finally, specialty search tools such as [_Shodan_](https://www.shodan.io/) can provide additional insight. Shodan is a search engine that crawls devices connected to the internet, including the servers that run websites, but also devices like routers and [_Internet of Things_](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iot/) (IoT) devices.
