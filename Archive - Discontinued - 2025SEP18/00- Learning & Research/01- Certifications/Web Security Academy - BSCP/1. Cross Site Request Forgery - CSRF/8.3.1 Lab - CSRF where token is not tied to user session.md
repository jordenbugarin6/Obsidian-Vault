login with `wiener` first, once logged in generate `update email` with `wiener@test.local` to generate `POST` request
![[Pasted image 20241230205320.png]]
now we have a `post` request for `wiener`

login with `carlos` user, and generate a new email `carlos@test.local`
![[Pasted image 20241230205737.png]]
now we have a `post` request
![[Pasted image 20241230205839.png]]
tried swapping the `CSRF` tokens between `wiener` & `carlos` but this didnt work - in order to get this to work we have to turn on `intercept` and intercept the `csrf` token before it is used.


----
trying again by restarting with `carlos3@test.local`
![[Pasted image 20241230210309.png]]
we hit `FORWARD` one time and now have the `CSRF` value - send this to repeater and hit `DROP` to drop the following traffic
![[Pasted image 20241230210357.png]]
now in `REPEATER` generate as `CSRF`
![[Pasted image 20241230210537.png]]
and changed the value to `carlos4`
![[Pasted image 20241230210608.png]]
turn off the `interceptor` and `Deliver Exeploit to Victim`
