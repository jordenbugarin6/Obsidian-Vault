In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- Browser and Integration
- Proxy and Scope
- The Core Burp Suite Tools and Tabs

Let's start by discussingÂ [_Burp Suite_](https://portswigger.net/burp), one of the most popular tools for penetration testing. Burp Suite is an integrated platform for web application security testing and auditing. It consists of multiple tools and capabilities targeted at testing web applications. Burp Suite will be one of our go-to tools from the early stages of mapping out an application through carrying out an attack.

We'll be approaching this new tool one section at a time; however, please proceed at a pace that is comfortable as we tackle the most important aspects of Burp Suite.

The concepts discussed in this Learning Module will be key to our future success in Offensive Security's WEB-200 and WEB-300 courses.

As a web assessor, Burp Suite is going to be our home more than 90% of the time.
