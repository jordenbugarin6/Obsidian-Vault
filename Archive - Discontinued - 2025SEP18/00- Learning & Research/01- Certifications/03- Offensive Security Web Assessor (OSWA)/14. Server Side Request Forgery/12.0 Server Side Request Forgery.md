In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- Introduction to Server-side Request Forgery
- Testing for SSRF
- Exploiting SSRF
- Case Study: Group Office SSRF Vulnerabilities

_Server-side Request Forgery_ (SSRF)[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/server-side-request-forgery-34430/server-side-request-forgery-34551#fn-local_id_64-1) occurs when an attacker can force an application or server to request data or a resource. Since the request is originating at the server, it might be able to access data that the attacker cannot access directly.

In this Learning Module, we will learn about the foundational aspects of SSRF, including how the vulnerability occurs, and how it interacts with the vulnerable server. Next, we will cover how to test for SSRF vulnerabilities and several exploitation approaches based on how an application generates the request. Finally, we will examine a case study with two SSRF vulnerabilities found in a real-world application.
