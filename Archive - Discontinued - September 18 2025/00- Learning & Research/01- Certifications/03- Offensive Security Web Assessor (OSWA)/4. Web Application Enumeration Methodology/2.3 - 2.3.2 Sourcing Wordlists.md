Wordlists are one of our most valuable resources as attackers. They are useful for enumerating web applications, automating vulnerability discovery, brute forcing logins for various protocols, cracking password hashes extracted from databases and configuration files, and much more.

--------------------------------------------------
#### 2.3.1 Common Wordlists
`ls -lh /usr/share/wordlists` 
[_SecLists_](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) contains multiple wordlists that cover discovery, fuzzing, common passwords, and web shells.

[_Payloads All The Things_](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) is another useful collection of wordlists focused on exploitation. This includes wordlists and markdown files with examples of many common web application vulnerabilities.

#### 2.3.2. Creating Custom Wordlists

[_CeWL_](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) is a custom wordlist generator that is included in Kali Linux. It crawls a URL and creates a list of words from the pages it discovers.

We'll run **cewl**, **--write** the results to **output.txt**, force output to **--lowercase**, and set **-m 4** to set the minimum word length to four characters, and then provide our target URL.

`cewl --write output.txt --lowercase -m 4 http://enum-sandbox/manual`
`tail output.txt` to show last 10 results from list

In addition to creating wordlists from web applications, there are other situations in which we may want to create wordlists. For example, if we know our target's operating system, we could build a wordlist of binaries that we might want to leverage in a [_command injection_](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection) attack.

For example, we could use **ls** to get the contents of **/usr/bin**, pipe the results to **grep**, use **-v /** to exclude directories, and redirect the results to a file.

`ls /usr/bin | grep -v "/" > binaries.txt`

##### Labs
`cewl --write labs.txt --lowercase -m 5 http://enum-sandbox`
