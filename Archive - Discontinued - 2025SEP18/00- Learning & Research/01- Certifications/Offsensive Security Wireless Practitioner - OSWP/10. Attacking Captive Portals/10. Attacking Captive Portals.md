Captive portals are often set up on unencrypted or open networks to allow guests or employees to easily connect to the network or Internet, sometimes without credentials.

Using a captive portal is relatively straightforward. A user connects to a particular network without having to enter any credentials. Once connected, the OS or browser will often detect there is a captive portal and automatically open a browser to log in. The welcome page sometimes contains rules and conditions or a login/password prompt.

Although a WPA Enterprise network would be a more secure option, it is more complicated to set up and administer. Provisioning devices is also more secure, but it is also more complex. Some businesses may choose to use a captive portal in order to avoid potential confusion or frustration on the part of the guests or customers, as the web page log-in mechanism is relatively familiar.

In this module, we will learn how to mount attacks against existing captive portals by creating our own, hoping to trick clients into disclosing their credentials.
