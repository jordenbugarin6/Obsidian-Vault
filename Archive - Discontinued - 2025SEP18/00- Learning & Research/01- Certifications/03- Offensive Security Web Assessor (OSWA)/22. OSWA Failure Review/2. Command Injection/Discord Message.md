If the basics fail what I typically do is look at the response and see what it accepts to rule out blacklisted characters/commands. Take for example a ping application: Start by seeing what it accepts %0a, %0a%09 (new line +tab) and get creative with it if need be. If it doesnt accept it, it will let you know in the response by an error message or not returning any data. If it's Blind Command Injection then curl or sleep might be your friend. Some examples of getting creative if the basics fail: ip=127.0.0.1%0a'i'd or this ip=127.0.0.1%0a${IFS}ls${IFS}-la (First example I gave: It's important to make sure the number of ' is even and that your not mixing single and double quotes) Here are some additional boxes you can practice on regarding Command Injection if needed(Proving Grounds Play: Shakabrah)( Hack The Box: TwoMillion, Photobomb, RedCross) You can also use FFUF to automate with wordlists to see if you get any hits. If f you want to supplement with some more training the Portswigger Command Injection labs may help too.
