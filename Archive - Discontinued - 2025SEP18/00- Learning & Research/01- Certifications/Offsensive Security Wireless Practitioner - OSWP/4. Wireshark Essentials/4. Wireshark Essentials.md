_Wireshark_,[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wireshark-essentials-15802/wireshark-essentials-15994#fn-local_id_101-1) previously known as _Ethereal_,[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wireshark-essentials-15802/wireshark-essentials-15994#fn-local_id_101-2) is the de-facto packet analysis tool. Wireshark can dissect a large number of common protocols, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, and 802.11, and more esoteric ones including ATM[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wireshark-essentials-15802/wireshark-essentials-15994#fn-local_id_101-3) and EtherCAT.[4](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wireshark-essentials-15802/wireshark-essentials-15994#fn-local_id_101-4) It handles live capture on different mediums, can open or save data in a number of capture formats, and allows us to do analysis and data graphing. The display and capture filters allow us to narrow down the amount of data displayed and received, which often comes in handy.

Last but not least, Wireshark is available on a wide variety of operating systems as a GUI and as a command line tool called _TShark_.[5](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wireshark-essentials-15802/wireshark-essentials-15994#fn-local_id_101-5) Wireshark includes other command line tools including _dumpcap_,[6](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-210-9545/learning/wireshark-essentials-15802/wireshark-essentials-15994#fn-local_id_101-6) which handles packet capture but doesn't do any dissection, and _SSHdump_, which simplifies remote packet capture via SSH. A number of other utilities are also provided.

In this module, we'll explore Wi-Fi-specific Wireshark features.
