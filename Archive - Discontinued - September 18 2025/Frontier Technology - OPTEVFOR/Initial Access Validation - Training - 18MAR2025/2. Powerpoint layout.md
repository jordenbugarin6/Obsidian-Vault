`Validating Initial Access - OPTEVFOR RT`

### **Slide 1: Why Validating Initial Access Matters:** 

**Critical for Client Reporting**
```
• Initial access validation is one of the most important pieces of evidence for the client.
```
**Foundation for Further Testing**
```
• Without a documented initial access vector, internal vulnerabilities lose significance.
```
**Challenges in Replication**
```
•Initial access isn't always straightforward—precise documentation ensures repeatability for new testers.
```
**Network Access Gaps**
```
•With CVPA/AA assessments becoming more segmented, quickly re-establishing access after breaks is essential.
```
### **Slide 2: Common Issues in Initial Access Validation:*** 

**Lack of Documentation**
```
- Missing records, skipped validation steps, or incorrect assumptions about connectivity.
```
 **Poor Documentation Quality**
```
- Unclear details on how access was gained or what the SME had to disable.
```
- **Client Confusion**
```
- Without clear initial access validation, clients may not understand how vulnerabilities were exploited.
```

### **Slide 3: Overview of Initial Access Validation**
 **Verify Physical Connection:**
```
- Confirm the correct port, cable, and physical location of the connection - can be more granular if necessary (Connected from room 4-95-3-M but this connects to SWITCH 3 10-Port Gigabit PoE in 13-95-3-M)
```
 **Verify Logical Access:**
```
- What VLAN and Subnet did you get dropped into? What are you able to touch?
```
**SME assistance**
```
- What did the SME do to allow connection to occur? Disable Port Security - Disable 802.1X - Increase amount of Mac's allowed on a port - Clear Sticky Mac
```
**Prevention Mechanisms**:
```
- Look for 802.1X, port security, or other restrictions.
- Typically tested by unplugging a port and plugging directly into it or plugging into an empty port
```
**Document Bypass Techniques**: 
```
- If access was gained by bypassing a control, it must be properly recorded.
```
**Connection Notes**
```
- Record DHCP usage, VLAN tagging, link aggregation, or any special configurations.
```

### **Slide 3: Common Initial Access Scenarios**
###### **Scenario 1: Plugging into an Open Network Port (No Port Security)**

**Verify Physical Connection:**
```
- Connected from room 4-95-3-M to SWITCH 3, 10-Port Gigabit PoE in 13-95-3-M.
```
**Verify Logical Access:**
```
- Ran `ifconfig`  to check the IP address `10.10.5.100` and subnet mask `0/24`. Verified correctly being placed into VLAN 10 (Management) by scanning devices `10.10.5.110` & `10.10.5.120` that only exist in the Management network 
```
 **SME Assistance:**
```
- No SME intervention is needed because the port is open and there are no security restrictions (i.e., no 802.1X, MAC filtering, or port security).
- The tester’s device automatically receives an IP address from the DHCP server, and no further steps are required to establish network access.
```
**Prevention Mechanisms:**
```
- No Prevention Mechanism in place
```
 **Document Bypass Techniques:**  
```
- N/A
```
**Connection Notes:**
```
- DHCP Information: IP address `10.10.5.100`, gateway `10.10.5.1`, DNS server `10.10.5.2`.
- The tester’s device was assigned to VLAN 10 (internal network access), as indicated by the subnet and IP range.
- No special configurations, link aggregation, or port trunking were observed
```

-----------------
###### **Scenario 2: Plugging into a Network Port (No DHCP Server, SME Assistance Required)**
**Verify Physical Connection:**
```
- Connected from room 4-95-3-M to SWITCH 3, 10-Port Gigabit PoE in 13-95-3-M.
```
**Verify Logical Access:**
```
- Ran ifconfig to check the IP address.  Manually assigned the IP address 10.10.5.100 and subnet mask 255.255.255.0 to the device.
- Verified the device was placed into VLAN 10 (Management) by scanning devices 10.10.5.110 & 10.10.5.120, which are part of the Management network, confirming the device is in the correct network.
```
**SME Assistance:**
```
- The tester contacted the SME, who disabled 802.1X authentication on the port to allow the tester's device to connect to the network.
- The SME confirmed the subnet to use and allowed the manual IP assignment (`10.10.5.100`), ensuring no IP conflicts with other devices in the network.
```
**Prevention Mechanisms:**
```
- 802.1X was initially enabled on the port, but the SME had to disable it to allow the device to connect.
```
**Document Bypass Techniques:**
```
- Bypassing 802.1X authentication was required to establish a connection. SME disabled 802.1X on  `Gi1/0/43`
```
**Connection Notes:**
```
- **IP Information:** IP address `10.10.5.100`, subnet mask `255.255.255.0`, manually assigned.
- **VLAN:** The device was placed in VLAN 10 (Management), based on the subnet and network resources.
- **Gateway:** `10.10.5.1`, **DNS server:** `10.10.5.2`.
- The device was manually configured to use an unused subnet to avoid conflicts with other devices.
- No special configurations, link aggregation, or port trunking were observed.
```
