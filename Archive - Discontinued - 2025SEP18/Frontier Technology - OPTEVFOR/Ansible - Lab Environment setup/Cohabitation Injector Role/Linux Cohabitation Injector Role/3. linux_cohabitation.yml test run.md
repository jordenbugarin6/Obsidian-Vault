The easiest way to ensure that `SPILLAGE` works correctly on both `WINDOWS` and `LINUX` is to have `2` separate `main.yml` files one named `windows_spillage.yml` and the other `linux_spillage.yml`

The execution of this playbook creates a directory named `China Number One` and drops two files into it to show `cohabitation`  - the first is `redteamcredentials.txt` which can have some sort of credentials in it as well as `stargate_safe.txt` which is some attacker notes to show that there is another attacker on the system.

Once execution has occurred the directory is listed so the proctor can ensure the successful deployment of the Injector Role
