any security controls enforced by an `API` gateway on traffic `ENTERING` the internal network would not apply to the traffic between the two microservices since the traffic originates `WITHIN` the internal network.

***our attacks will be limited by our knowledge of the internal hostnames or the private IP range used by the internal network.***

- this is saying if we find an `SSRF` vulnerability we may be able to access endpoints that we should not be able to due to `BECOMING` the server via `PROXY` , the lab shows this well.

#### Labs
`1.`

at the endpoint `http://localhost/status`we can identify that the `IP` for the `ssrf-sandbox` is `10.10.10.7`
![[Pasted image 20250108174503.png]]we can also see the `/flag` endpoint is present

however if we attempt to connect to the endpoint `http://10.10.10.7/flag` we are unsuccessful at getting the flag - this is because we are trying to hit the `IP` from an external interface.

if we attempt to hit the `/flag` endpoint `INTERNALLY` we `DO NOT HAVE TO AUTHENTICATE`, so lets try the `http://localhost/flag` endpoint

- because we are hitting the `internal` interface we are able to bypass the `API` authentication
