this flag picks up where [[Headed down another path]] leaves off, once on the machine enumerate the user directories. Not the `C:\Projects\.git`  path, it is just meant to waste your time.

this leads you to `C:\Documents and Settings\joe\Documents` which has `SharpChrome.exe` - this was the first time i've seen this so I over looked it.

I injected into `session 1 & session 2` and ran `execute-assembly /usr/share/poshc2/resources/modules/SharpChrome.exe logins` but was unable to get the flag when it supposedly should've been shown.
- Note that when attempting to inject into multiple `session 2` processes it would just kill my beacons for 3-5 minutes before bringing them back.

in order for me to get successfully get the flag I had to `rdp` in, which was inoperable/unstable/ and would constantly crash around 30 times before I was able to get the passwords in the google password storage location.

here is the `rdesktop` command that worked: 
- Note: `xfreerdp` would just hang and never connect.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[10Jan2024 19:34:46]-[~/SUT/offshore/ws03 enum/sharpchrome.exe]
â””â”€# proxychains rdesktop -u joe -d dev.admin.offshore.com 172.16.2.102
```

navigate to google chrome password manager to see flag.
