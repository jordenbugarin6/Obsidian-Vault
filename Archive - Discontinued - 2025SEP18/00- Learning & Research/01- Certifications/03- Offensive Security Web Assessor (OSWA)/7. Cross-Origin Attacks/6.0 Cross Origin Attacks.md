# 6. Cross-Origin Attacks

In this Learning Module, we will cover the following Learning Units:

- Same-Origin Policy
- SameSite Cookies
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Case Study: Apache OFBiz CSRF Vulnerability
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Exploiting Weak CORS Policies

Web applications used to be _monolithic_,[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/cross-origin-attacks-30961/cross-origin-attacks-31403#fn-local_id_107-1) containing all data, resources, and content on a single domain. While some web applications still follow this pattern, many modern web applications load data and resources, such as JavaScript, from multiple domains. When one domain instructs the browser to request resources from a different domain, the request is considered _cross-origin_ or _cross-site_.

In this Learning Module, we will review two types of cross-origin attacks. These attacks target users that have authenticated sessions on the vulnerable application and exploit how browsers handle cookies. First, we will review the _Same Origin Policy_[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/cross-origin-attacks-30961/cross-origin-attacks-31403#fn-local_id_107-2) (SOP) to understand how it interacts with these attacks. The first attack we will cover is _Cross-Site Request Forgery_[3](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/cross-origin-attacks-30961/cross-origin-attacks-31403#fn-local_id_107-3) (CSRF). This exploit is becoming more difficult to employ due to browser protections, but it will serve as important foundational knowledge for attacking misconfigured _Cross-Origin Resources Sharing_[4](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/web-200-28380/learning/cross-origin-attacks-30961/cross-origin-attacks-31403#fn-local_id_107-4) (CORS), the second attack we will cover.
