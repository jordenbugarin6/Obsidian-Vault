Pulling SharpView.exe from Gobots to Windows Server 2019 to change .NET framework in Visual Studio 2019

Pulled Entire zipped SharpView Directory off github on WIndows Server 2019 to change .NET framework in Visual Studio 2019
`https://github.com/tevora-threat/SharpView/tree/master`
![[Pasted image 20230926105042.png]]
Navigated  to Visual Studo 2019 and changed the .net framework to 4.0

Create a new Visual Studio 2019 Project as a Class Library .Net Framework
![[Pasted image 20230926110357.png]]
Set Desired framework, in this case .NET Framework 4
![[Pasted image 20230926110449.png]]
Once in the project with the proper framework open the zip folder
![[Pasted image 20230926110709.png]]
Double click the .sln file ( Visual Studio Solution File )
Press the Start Button to start code in release version.
New SharpView.exe with .NET 4.0 framework is now loaded in the highlighted file path.
`C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\SharpView-master\SharpView-master\SharpView\bin\Release`

Tranferring this .exe version to Gobots
Moving the new SharpView.exe to the python folder ( python isnt an environmental variable - need system to do )
