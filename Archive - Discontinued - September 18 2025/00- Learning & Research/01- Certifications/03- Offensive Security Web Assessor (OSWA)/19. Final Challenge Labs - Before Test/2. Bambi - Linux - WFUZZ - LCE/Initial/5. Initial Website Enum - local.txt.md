#### Starting Point 
- interesting `gobuster` paths

- this website is an `advertisement` or `blog` for the music group `the challengerz`, specific language is utilized on this web page
- here is some info on the musicians
![[Pasted image 20250102204205.png]]
- more specifically utilized lingo when scrolling further down - this leads me to thinking to use `cewl`
![[Pasted image 20250102204232.png]]
##### CEWL
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[03Dec2024 21:19:55]-[/home/â€¦/SUT/OSWA/challenge_labs/bambi]
â””â”€# cewl --write passwords_all.txt http://bambi
```
- proof that this worked to generate a password list, we already have the users `SAM, DEVON, Johnny` - im going to put the password - `nullnullnull` at the top of the list so we have something to test against
![[Pasted image 20250102204429.png]]
##### /dev
login page, note from `admin` - 3 users, `SAM, DEVON, Johnny`

##### Fuzzing Password Spray
- generating a post request first with `test:test`
![[Pasted image 20250102204646.png]]
- got an obvious error, sending to `INTRUDER`
![[Pasted image 20250102204742.png]]
- changing the `username` field to `Sam`
- going to test the password field
![[Pasted image 20250102204850.png]]
- under `payloads` added my `custom` wordlist `passwords_all.txt` you can see the `nullnullnull` at the top
![[Pasted image 20250102204928.png]]
- I wasnt able to crack anything for the user `Sam` but was able to `FUZZ` the password for `Devon` with a sniper attack

`Devon:neoclassical`
![[Pasted image 20250102220901.png]]
- we were able to login at `/dev` with these credentials and get the flag
