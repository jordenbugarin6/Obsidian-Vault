There are two sets of tools to set, show, or change wireless card parameters. _iw_, the modern set of tools, are made for the newer mac80211 framework. On the other side, _iwconfig_ (and others, such as _iwpriv_), dating back from the early 2000's, were made for the ieee80211 framework. While iwconfig can still be used for some of the mac80211 features, they are deprecated and limited compared to the capabilities of iw.

We'll discuss the mac80211 framework and the ieee80211 framework later in this module. For now, let's explore the features and capabilities of both toolsets. We'll begin with the legacy tools.
