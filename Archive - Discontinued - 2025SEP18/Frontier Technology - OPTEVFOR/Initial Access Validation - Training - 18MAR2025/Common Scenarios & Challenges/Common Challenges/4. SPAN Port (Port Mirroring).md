If you get plugged into a port from an `Administrator` during a pen test and are unable to get responses when running multiple commands you could be plugged into a Mirrored Port.
![[Pasted image 20250422221746.png]]
No response from `ping`
```bash
ping X.X.X.X
```
No open ports, no ping replies from `nmap`
```bash
nmap -Pn <host>
```
No `ARP` entries are shown
```bash
arp -a
```

### Why Port Mirroring could be used.

-  **To limit access**: The port may be a **monitoring-only interface** â€” designed to observe traffic without allowing active interaction with the network.
-  **For diagnostics**: It's often called a **maintenance or monitor port**, used by IT or security teams to validate traffic flows and visibility.
-  **To preserve security boundaries**: The goal is to allow **passive recon** (sniffing, protocol analysis), while **preventing any exploitation**, MITM, or active scanning.
### What You _Can_ Do on a Mirrored Port:

- Capture credentials
- Watch clear-text protocols
- Monitor service behaviors
- Spot internal misconfigurations

### Keep in mind

if you plug into something and are seeing stuff it doesn't always mean yu can see everything
