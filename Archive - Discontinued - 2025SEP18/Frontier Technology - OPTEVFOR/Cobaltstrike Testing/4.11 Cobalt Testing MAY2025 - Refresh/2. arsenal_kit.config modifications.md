## Reflective Loader Size in KB
# Valid values are 0, 5, and 100
#
# For Cobalt Strike version 4.8 and earlier the value 0 is the same as 5
# For Cobalt Strike version 4.9 and later the value 0 indicates you want
# a beacon dll without a reflective loader to be used with a prepended
# loader (sRDI/Double Pulsar).
#
# This setting affects the urdl_kit and artifact_kit.  The recommendation
# is to use either the value of 5 or 100.  The reason is the udrl_kit
# only supports the stomped "Stephen Fewer" style loader which requires
# the value of 5 or 100.  The artifact_kit only uses this information to
# validate that the artifactkit_stage_size is a minimum size or larger.
# The value of 0 or 5 uses the same minimum size while the value of 100
# uses a larger size.

# Set which version of Sleepmask is to be generated

# Sleepmask Mask the text section of beacon
# This determines if the text section of beacon should be masked when sleeping.

# text section of beacon.
# NOTE: if the stage.userwx is set to true then sleep mask will mask the

# NOTE: the 4.10 version will now force this setting to true in the build script.

#    none                - sleepmask will use standard windows api functions

#                          randomized method.
#    beacon              - sleepmask will use syscalls information provided
