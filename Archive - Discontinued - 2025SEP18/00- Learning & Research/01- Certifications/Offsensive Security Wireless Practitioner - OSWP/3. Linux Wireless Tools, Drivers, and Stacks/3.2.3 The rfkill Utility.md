`rfkill`Â is a tool to enable or disable connected wireless devices. We can use it for Wi-Fi, as well as for Bluetooth, mobile broadband such as 4G/LTE, 5G, WiMax, GPS, FM, NFC, and any other radio.

Let's runÂ rfkill listÂ to display all the enabled Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices on the system:
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[15Apr2025 21:10:26]-[/opt/cobaltstrike]
â””â”€# rfkill list
1: phy1: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
```
"Soft blocked" refers to a block from rfkill, done in software. "Hard blocked" refers to a physical switch or BIOS parameter for the device. rfkill can only change soft blocks.

A radio can be disabled (soft blocked) usingÂ rfkill blockÂ followed by the device's ID number that is displayed in theÂ rfkill listÂ command. Using the previous output, we will execute theÂ rfkillÂ command to disable our Wi-Fi device:
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[15Apr2025 21:17:14]-[/opt/cobaltstrike]
â””â”€# sudo rfkill block 1
```
If the command is successful, nothing is displayed.
We runÂ `rfkill list 1`Â to specifically list our disabled Wi-Fi device:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[15Apr2025 21:18:15]-[/opt/cobaltstrike]
â””â”€# sudo rfkill list 1 
1: phy1: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: yes
        Hard blocked: no
```
To re-enable our Wi-Fi device we will runÂ rfkillÂ with theÂ unblockÂ parameter:
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[15Apr2025 21:18:18]-[/opt/cobaltstrike]
â””â”€# sudo rfkill unblock 1
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[15Apr2025 21:18:18]-[/opt/cobaltstrike]
â””â”€# sudo rfkill list 1   
1: phy1: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no

```
We can disable all radios at the same time with theÂ block allÂ parameter:
And all the devices can be re-enabled usingÂ rfkillÂ with theÂ unblock allÂ parameter.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[15Apr2025 21:23:49]-[/opt/cobaltstrike]
â””â”€# sudo rfkill block all
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[15Apr2025 21:24:24]-[/opt/cobaltstrike]
â””â”€# sudo rfkill list     
1: phy1: Wireless LAN
        Soft blocked: yes
        Hard blocked: no
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[15Apr2025 21:24:29]-[/opt/cobaltstrike]
â””â”€# sudo rfkill unblock all
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€gobots)-[15Apr2025 21:24:39]-[/opt/cobaltstrike]
â””â”€# sudo rfkill list

        Soft blocked: no
        Hard blocked: no
