- A `class` is like a `template` for making objects.
- Inside a class, you usually have:
    - `Variables` (to store data)
    - `Methods` (functions that do stuff with that data)
- When you want to **create an object** from a class, you use a special function called a **constructor**.
    - The constructor usually has the same name as the class.
    - It sets up the object’s data (called **instance variables**).
    
```java
public class MyClass //You're creating a **new class** called `MyClass`. Think of this as a **template** for making objects.
{
    private int myNumber; //Inside the class, there's a private variable named `myNumber` — it can **only be accessed inside** this class. It stores an integer (whole number).

    // constructor
    public MyClass(int aNumber) //a special method that runs **automatically** when you create a new `MyClass` object. It takes a value called `aNumber` as input and **saves it into** the variable `myNumber`.
    {
        this.myNumber = aNumber; //The this. keyword means “the version of myNumber that belongs to this object.” You're setting the object’s internal number (myNumber) to whatever number was passed in (aNumber).
    }
    
    public getNumber() //This is a method (function) that returns the value of `myNumber` when called.  It lets code outside the class safely read that private value.
    {
      return myNumber;
    }
}
```

In programming, things like classes, variables, and methods usually start with something called an **access modifier**, like `public` or `private`.
- **Public** means it can be used by code _outside_ the class.
- **Private** means it can _only_ be used _inside_ the class.
In the earlier example:
- Anyone can call the `MyClass` constructor because it's public.
- But the variable `myNumber` is private, so code outside the object **can’t access it directly** — it has to use the public `getNumber()` method.

Understanding these rules will be useful later when we write our own code or analyze programs during exploits and reverse engineering.
