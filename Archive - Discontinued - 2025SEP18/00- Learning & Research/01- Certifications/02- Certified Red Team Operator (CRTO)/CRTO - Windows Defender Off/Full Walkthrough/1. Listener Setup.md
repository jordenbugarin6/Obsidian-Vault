## Setting up the teams server
Booted up the Attacker Desktop VM.
Ran this command to startup cobalt strike server - 10.10.5.50 is the Attacker Linux box.
```bash
attacker@ubuntu cd cobaltstrike/
attacker@ubuntu ~/cobaltstrike> sudo ./teamserver 10.10.5.50 Passw0rd! c2-profiles/normal/webbug.profile
```

going to utilize this pipe format

pipe format typed due to inability to copy and paste from VM. I modifed the last 4 digits to 1337 so I could recognize it.
```powershell
TSVCPIPE-55d3272f-cf2f-4958-90dd-18468b6b1337
